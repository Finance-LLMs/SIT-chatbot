    "Demand for Dietitians in Singapore",
    "The current health trends in Singapore indicate an increasing incidence of diet-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has reported a 56% increase in demand for dietitians in acute care from 2010 to 2015. Currently, the only way to achieve a recognised dietetics academic qualification is through an overseas degree. SIT’s new",
    "Dietetics and Nutrition",
    "degree programme aims to address the lack of a specialised undergraduate dietetics degree in Singapore.",
    "Developed in close consultation with chief dietitians from Singapore’s three major public healthcare clusters, the four-year Bachelor degree programme will provide students with evidence-based theoretical knowledge, research skills, and industry-relevant practical experience across all domains of dietetics practice. This will enable aspiring dietitians to apply their skills in managing medical conditions, disease prevention and health promotion.",
    "The pioneer intake will commence classes in September 2019. As part of SIT’s applied learning pedagogy, students will undergo a 32-week clinical practice education with various public and private healthcare institutions throughout their curriculum.",
    "Dr Lim Su Lin, Chief Dietitian & Senior Assistant Director, Dietetics Department, National University Hospital, said: “Dietetics combines the scientific knowledge of health, disease, food and nutrition, and the art of applying human psychology and communication to translate clinical information and advice to patients. There definitely is a growing need for dietitians on the back of the challenges posed by the increasing ageing population. Dietitians are key members of the multidisciplinary healthcare team in a hospital. They assess patients and implement specific nutritional interventions in relation to their medical conditions. This programme is timely in the absence of an academic degree locally. We are excited about SIT’s collaborative and consultative approach in engaging dietitians from various healthcare organisations to develop the aims, learning outcomes and curriculum framework for this specialised degree.”",
    "Professor Loh Han Tong, Deputy President (Academic) & Provost, SIT, commented: “We are pleased to add the Dietetics and Nutrition degree to our health sciences offerings. Students will develop skills to be critical-thinkers and have opportunities to learn alongside dietitians who are active practitioners in real-life clinical settings. Through theoretical and clinical education recommended by international professional dietetics organisations, graduates will be well prepared for the role of an entry-level professional dietitian.”",
    "Skilled Air Transport Professionals for Aviation Transformation",
    "With the development of Changi Airport Terminals 4 and 5, manpower needs in the aviation sector are projected to increase till 2035. To strengthen the pipeline of skilled aviation professionals in order to meet future manpower demand in the expanding aviation industry, SIT will launch the",
    "first and only",
    "Air Transport Management",
    "degree programme in Singapore. The curriculum for the three-year programme has been developed in close partnership with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and aviation companies.",
    "Covering operations, management and business aspects of the air transport industry, the programme will train students to become skilled practitioners in airports, airlines, ground handling agencies as well as aviation consultancy firms. Students will undergo an eight-month Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP), a signature feature of SIT-conferred degrees, in their third year. The work attachment will see students actively apply theoretical knowledge to solve problems and gain first-hand industry experience in air transport-related companies.",
    "“SIT’s new degree programme in Air Transport Management will help expand the air transport manpower pipeline, and enhance job-readiness of students and job-seekers looking to join the sector. The programme is designed in partnership with CAAS, to ensure relevance to the industry’s needs. Graduates of the programme may consider careers in the air transport sector, as well as at CAAS,” said Mr Ho Yuen Sang, Director (Aviation Industry), CAAS.",
    "Strengthening Partnership with UofG to Boost Talent Pipeline in Engineering and ICT Sectors",
    "A new collaboration agreement between SIT and University of Glasgow (UofG) will see the roll out of three SIT-UofG joint degrees to cater to demand for engineers and ICT professionals with qualifications and skills beyond their core areas.",
    "The joint degree in",
    "Aerospace Engineering",
    "is a three-year degree programme which aims to equip students with application-oriented training in aerospace engineering in Singapore’s context, with an emphasis on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. It will also be the first aerospace undergraduate programme that specialises in unmanned systems, a fast-growing area in Singapore’s aviation and aerospace sector.",
    "Designed to support the government’s initiative to transform Singapore into a Smart Nation, the joint degree in",
    "Computing Science",
    "is the first computing programme offered by an Autonomous University in Singapore that specialises in the Internet of Things (IoT). The three-year programme encompasses a broad-based curriculum which combines knowledge from IoT, software engineering, data analytics, cyber security and machine learning.",
    "The",
    "Mechanical Engineering",
    "degree programme provides two specialisation tracks, namely in Design and Mechatronics. The",
    "Design",
    "specialisation focuses on the concepts of digital manufacturing and design, while the",
    "Mechatronics",
    "specialisation trains students in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) used for automation and robotics, unmanned systems, and co-bot design.",
    "All SIT-UofG joint degrees will feature the eight-month IWSP where students will work and train in companies related to their specialisation, to develop deep specialist skills in their chosen field. In addition, students are required to complete the Overseas Immersion Programme in Glasgow, United Kingdom to gain cross-cultural awareness on industry best practices.",
    "SIT Admissions Exercise and Open House 2019",
    "For AY2019/2020, SIT will offer 42 degree programmes, of which 14 are SIT’s own degree programmes, 15 are joint degree programmes and 13 are overseas university programmes.",

These are the\nfirst\nof such undergraduate programmes to be offered by an Autonomous University in Singapore.\nAdditionally, a new agreement between SIT and the University of Glasgow (UofG) will see the provision of three additional joint degrees in AY2019/2020, with both universities co-developing and co-teaching the curricula. The three programmes will focus on emerging technologies that will not only address the challenges, but also reshape business models and strategies in the engineering and ICT sectors.\nDegree Programme\nTruncated\nDuration\nBachelor of Science with Honours in Dietetics and Nutrition\nDietetics and Nutrition,BSc (Hons)\n4 years\nBachelor of Science with Honours in Air Transport Management\nAir Transport Management, BSc (Hons)\n3 years\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Aerospace Engineering –\njoint degree programme offered by SIT and University of Glasgow\nAerospace Engineering, BEng (Hons)\n3 years\nBachelor of Science with Honours in Computing Science –\njoint degree programme offered by SIT and University of Glasgow\nComputing Science,BSc (Hons)\n3 years\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering –\njoint degree programme offered by SIT and University of Glasgow\nMechanical Engineering, BEng (Hons)\n3 years\nDemand for Dietitians in Singapore\nThe current health trends in Singapore indicate an increasing incidence of diet-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has reported a 56% increase in demand for dietitians in acute care from 2010 to 2015. Currently, the only way to achieve a recognised dietetics academic qualification is through an overseas degree. SIT’s new\nDietetics and Nutrition\ndegree programme aims to address the lack of a specialised undergraduate dietetics degree in Singapore.\nDeveloped in close consultation with chief dietitians from Singapore’s three major public healthcare clusters, the four-year Bachelor degree programme will provide students with evidence-based theoretical knowledge, research skills, and industry-relevant practical experience across all domains of dietetics practice. This will enable aspiring dietitians to apply their skills in managing medical conditions, disease prevention and health promotion.\nThe pioneer intake will commence classes in September 2019. As part of SIT’s applied learning pedagogy, students will undergo a 32-week clinical practice education with various public and private healthcare institutions throughout their curriculum.\nDr Lim Su Lin, Chief Dietitian & Senior Assistant Director, Dietetics Department, National University Hospital, said: “Dietetics combines the scientific knowledge of health, disease, food and nutrition, and the art of applying human psychology and communication to translate clinical information and advice to patients. There definitely is a growing need for dietitians on the back of the challenges posed by the increasing ageing population. Dietitians are key members of the multidisciplinary healthcare team in a hospital. They assess patients and implement specific nutritional interventions in relation to their medical conditions. This programme is timely in the absence of an academic degree locally. We are excited about SIT’s collaborative and consultative approach in engaging dietitians from various healthcare organisations to develop the aims, learning outcomes and curriculum framework for this specialised degree.”\nProfessor Loh Han Tong, Deputy President (Academic) & Provost, SIT, commented: “We are pleased to add the Dietetics and Nutrition degree to our health sciences offerings. Students will develop skills to be critical-thinkers and have opportunities to learn alongside dietitians who are active practitioners in real-life clinical settings. Through theoretical and clinical education recommended by international professional dietetics organisations, graduates will be well prepared for the role of an entry-level professional dietitian.”\nSkilled Air Transport Professionals for Aviation Transformation\nWith the development of Changi Airport Terminals 4 and 5, manpower needs in the aviation sector are projected to increase till 2035. To strengthen the pipeline of skilled aviation professionals in order to meet future manpower demand in the expanding aviation industry, SIT will launch the\nfirst and only\nAir Transport Management\ndegree programme in Singapore. The curriculum for the three-year programme has been developed in close partnership with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and aviation companies.\nCovering operations, management and business aspects of the air transport industry, the programme will train students to become skilled practitioners in airports, airlines, ground handling agencies as well as aviation consultancy firms. Students will undergo an eight-month Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP), a signature feature of SIT-conferred degrees, in their third year. The work attachment will see students actively apply theoretical knowledge to solve problems and gain first-hand industry experience in air transport-related companies.\n“SIT’s new degree programme in Air Transport Management will help expand the air transport manpower pipeline, and enhance job-readiness of students and job-seekers looking to join the sector. The programme is designed in partnership with CAAS, to ensure relevance to the industry’s needs. Graduates of the programme may consider careers in the air transport sector, as well as at CAAS,” said Mr Ho Yuen Sang, Director (Aviation Industry), CAAS.\nStrengthening Partnership with UofG to Boost Talent Pipeline in Engineering and ICT Sectors\nA new collaboration agreement between SIT and University of Glasgow (UofG) will see the roll out of three SIT-UofG joint degrees to cater to demand for engineers and ICT professionals with qualifications and skills beyond their core areas.\nThe joint degree in\nAerospace Engineering\nis a three-year degree programme which aims to equip students with application-oriented training in aerospace engineering in Singapore’s context, with an emphasis on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. It will also be the first aerospace undergraduate programme that specialises in unmanned systems, a fast-growing area in Singapore’s aviation and aerospace sector.\nDesigned to support the government’s initiative to transform Singapore into a Smart Nation, the joint degree in\nComputing Science\nis the first computing programme offered by an Autonomous University in Singapore that specialises in the Internet of Things (IoT). The three-year programme encompasses a broad-based curriculum which combines knowledge from IoT, software engineering, data analytics, cyber security and machine learning.\nThe\nMechanical Engineering\ndegree programme provides two specialisation tracks, namely in Design and Mechatronics. The\nDesign\nspecialisation focuses on the concepts of digital manufacturing and design, while the\nMechatronics\nspecialisation trains students in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) used for automation and robotics, unmanned systems, and co-bot design.\nAll SIT-UofG joint degrees will feature the eight-month IWSP where students will work and train in companies related to their specialisation, to develop deep specialist skills in their chosen field. In addition, students are required to complete the Overseas Immersion Programme in Glasgow, United Kingdom to gain cross-cultural awareness on industry best practices.\nSIT Admissions Exercise and Open House 2019\nFor AY2019/2020, SIT will offer 42 degree programmes, of which 14 are SIT’s own degree programmes, 15 are joint degree programmes and 13 are overseas university programmes.\nSIT’s admissions period for AY2019/2020 is from 11 January to 19 March 2019. Interested students can apply via the SIT website at SingaporeTech.edu.sg. SIT takes a holistic approach in assessing applicants, taking into consideration academic results, extra-curricular interests and the candidate’s passion and personal qualities. Relevant work experience will also be considered and all shortlisted applicants will be assessed through interviews.\nThe\nSIT Open House\nwill be held at Suntec Convention & Exhibition Centre, Level 3, from 12 to 13 January 2019. Prospective students will have the opportunity to speak to lecturers, staff and students on-site to find out more about SIT’s degree offerings, financial assistance schemes and scholarships available, as well as receive career advice. Representatives from the various student clubs and societies will also give interested applicants a glimpse of the vibrant student life awaiting them.\nAbout Singapore Institute of Technology\nSingapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is Singapore’s university of applied learning.
