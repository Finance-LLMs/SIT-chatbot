    "Extrusion and texture-characterisation are vital for creating plant-based meats with meat-like texture. These processes ensure product consistency, consumer acceptance, and innovation, driving the success of high-quality, appealing plant-based products.",
    "This course offers comprehensive theory and practical training in mechanics of materials, rheology, rheological and texture analysis methods, and extrusion basics. Learners will explore the biochemistry of biopolymers like starches, fats, enzymes, and binders crucial for plant-based meat (PBM) formulation. They will learn to analyse formulations and finished products using TPA and rheometers. Additionally, learners will delve into various testing methods and data analysis with hands-on experience in texturing formulations using high-moisture or low-moisture extrusion.",
