The  average  level  of\nstress came to 7.6.\nEighty-nine per cent of the re-\nspondents  said  work  and  study\ncommitments  were  among  their\ntop five sources of stress, while 68\nper cent said it was a lack of confi-\ndence in their own abilities.\nSixty-four per cent cited career\nprospects after university, and the\nsame proportion said it was per-\nsonal relationships.\nThese results and more were in\nthe UCare Mental Health Report,\nwhich was presented to Minister\nfor Culture, Community and Youth\nand Second Minister for Law Ed-\nwin  Tong  at  the  UCare  Mental\nHealth Forum yesterday.\nSpeaking to The Straits Times at\nthe  sidelines  of  the  event,  Ms\nShyanne Loh, 28, a student leader\nat the Singapore Institute of Tech-\nnology – which collaborated with\nIUN on the report – noted that the\nemphasis in Singapore for the past\nfew  years  has  been  on  raising\nawareness of mental health issues.\nShe hopes the report will result\nin  more  concrete  action  being\ntaken to address the issues.\nThe IUN said in its report that the\nsurvey results suggest the huge re-\nsponsibility undergraduates have\nplaced upon themselves to do well\nin their studies.\nOne recommendation was the in-\ntroduction of “grace days”, which\nare allowable delays beyond a spec-\nified deadline that can be applied to all assignments, and do not need\nprior approval for usage.\nNoting that several universities\naround  the  world  have  adopted\nthis practice, the IUN said it would\ngive students a flexible way to han-\ndle their academic issues without\nhaving to approach other individu-\nals, such as their lecturers.\nThe IUN added that students feel\nthere is a “deep-seated and  un-\nhealthy  obsession  with  their\ngrades”, as employers continue to\nuse these as the primary part of\nscreening for the hiring process.\nThis in turn leads to an increase\nin  stress  during  undergraduates’\neducation, with students primarily\nfocused on chasing grades and out-doing their peers rather than enjoy-\ning learning, said the IUN, calling\nfor a review of universities’ curric-\nula, grading systems and mental\nhealth resources.\nMore than half the respondents –\nabout 280 – said they had not used\nany of the mental health resources\nprovided by their university’s ad-\nministration.\nOf this group, 19 per cent said\nthey had heard unsatisfactory re-\nmarks  about  the  services  from\nother students.\nThe IUN said it was crucial to im-\nprove the quality of the resources\navailable to the undergraduate pop-\nulation, so students feel supported.\nIt also noted that 15 per cent of those who did not use university-\nprovided services said this was be-\ncause of the inefficiency of such\nservices.\n“Such patterns suggest the need\nfor  universities  and  government\nbodies to look into ways to provide\nmore  support  to  ease  the  man-\npower bottleneck that university\nmental health services face,” it said.\nAsked about the issue of univer-\nsity-initiated  mental  health  re-\nsources  being  overwhelmed,  Ms\nRebecca Tay, 22, director of well-\nness in the student government of\nYale-NUS College, whose student\nleaders are part of IUN, said it is im-\nportant for university administra-\ntions to understand the stressors\nthat students face and put forth ini-\ntiatives to tackle them.\nShe  said:  “I  think  rather  than\ncounsellors being the single solu-\ntion to every single mental health\nemergency  students  face,  more\nstakeholders can  come  into this\nconversation and contribute their\nefforts as well.”\nNearly 400 of the respondents\nsaid they had not made use of any\nstudent-led mental health  initia-\ntives, with 26 per cent of this group\nsaying they did not know how to\nstart or where to get help.\nThe report suggested more ef-\nfort be  put  into publicising  and\nplanning student-led initiatives.\n“Overall, such a higher usage of\nstudent-led initiatives may then re-\nduce the strain placed upon stu-\ndents’ oversubscribing to an over-\nencumbered university counselling service by offering alternative, com-\nplementary avenues of support,” it\nsaid.\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Tong\nsaid data from the National Youth\nCouncil’s  Monthly  Youth  Senti-\nments Tracker, from February to\nOctober last year, found that one\nin five youth reported poor or very\npoor mental well-being.\nEmphasising  that  action  is\nneeded at every level to tackle men-\ntal health issues, he highlighted a\nnumber of initiatives by the Gov-\nernment and in the community,\nand added that individuals have a\npart to play too.\nHe called on people to play the\nrole of mental health first respon-\nders, and said: “Continue to share\nviews and have conversations, so\nthat we can normalise the discus-\nsions around mental health... don’t\nbe afraid to seek help when you\nneed help. It is not a sign of weak-\nness, it is not a sign of failure.”\nMs Tay and Ms Loh both said that\nrather  than  a  sign  that  today’s\nyouth are weak, the IUN’s calls for a\nreview of the academic system are\nan effort of the younger generation\nto address the challenges they face\nwith better tools and perspectives.\nMs Tay said: “All these are how\nwe can work towards a different\nreality,  where  youth  are  still\nachieving their goals – but now\nthey’re given the right resources\nto help them go even further into\nthe future.”\ntimgoh@sph.com.sgAbove: Students studying on the NUS\ncampus.

Review universities’\nacademic infrastructure to\nprioritise mental health\nbefore grades.\n2. Offer flexibility in the\nworkload and curriculum,\nincluding introducing “grace\ndays”.\n3.
