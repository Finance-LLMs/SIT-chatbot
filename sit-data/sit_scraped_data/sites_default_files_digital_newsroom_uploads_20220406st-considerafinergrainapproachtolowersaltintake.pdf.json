Based\non the National Nutrition Survey\n2010, our daily salt intake was\n8.3g per day. That rose to 9g per\nday in 2018, the latest year for\nwhich figures were available.\nSalt comprises one part sodium\nand one part chloride. So 9g of\nsalt, for example, equals around\n3.6g of sodium.\nWhile the increase in intake\nmay seem small, it is cause for\nconcern and the groundwork is\nbeing laid to prepare for the phase\nof tackling high sodium intake.\nHealthier Choice Symbols have\nbeen created for Lower In Sodium\nand No Added Sodium categories,\nwith more than 200 products\nfalling into this category. Local\ncompanies have also developed\nproducts with lower sodium\ncontent, paving the way for future\nresearch and development in this\narea.\nHPB’s initiatives cover three\nmain areas: Working with salt\nsuppliers and the food service\nsector to encourage the\nsubstitution of regular salt with\nlower-sodium alternatives;\nintensifying existing efforts to\nspur industry reformulation of\nlower-sodium salt, sauces and\nseasonings; and starting a\nnationwide campaign to\nencourage Singaporeans to\nconsume less salt.\nWhile these initiatives are\nuseful, other key areas should also\nbe considered as part of a holistic\napproach to reduce salt intake.\nTARGETS TO CUT SALT INTAKE\nThe World Health Organisation\n(WHO) recommends that adults\nreduce their salt intake to less\nthan 5g – just under one teaspoon\n– per day, with the principal\nbenefit being lowering high blood\npressure and risk of\ncardiovascular disease, stroke\nand coronary heart attack. As it is\ndifficult to cut salt intake by such\na significant amount within a\nshort period, it is important to\nestablish clear, progressive and\nachievable targets, especially in\nterms of daily salt intake.\nIn addition, it would be useful to\nestimate how much impact the\nnew initiatives will have on the\noverall reduction in salt intake.\nFor example, salt substitutes may\ncontain 30 per cent less sodium,\nbut this does not necessarily\ntranslate to an overall 30 per cent\nless sodium intake.\nBy clearly expressing the\nexpected impact from each\ninitiative, it would be easier for\nvarious stakeholders to link their\nefforts to the common benefits.\nThe numbers may also reveal if\nthere are any other areas that\nneed to be focused on to\ncomplement existing efforts.\nVOLUNTARY V COMMITTED\nSALT REDUCTION\nSome countries have established\nvoluntary salt targets in the\nreformulation of products by\nfood producers. While this is\noften a good first step to\nencourage participation from key\nstakeholders, it may not always\nmake a significant impact. Food\nproducers are often reluctant to\nreduce the salt content of their\nproducts for fear of losing\nconsumers to competitors who\nhave not done so. Recognisable\ncommitment documents from\nfood producers could be required.\nA further step would be to set\nmandatory limits of sodium\ncontent for a few key products.\nFor example, Argentina initiated\nvoluntary agreements with food\ncompanies, bakeries and\nrestaurants in 2011, and\nthereafter established a sodium\nreduction law in 2013. Between 2011 and 2015, average daily salt\nintake reportedly fell by 2g per\nday.\nDEVELOPMENT OF\nTECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS\nReducing salt is technologically\ndifficult. In terms of flavour, salt\nplays a major and relatively\ninexpensive role in adding taste\nand flavour to food. Salt also\ncontributes to food structuring\nand preservation.\nA low hanging fruit is to either\nreduce salt by a small amount or\nto reformulate using salt\nsubstitutes. In fact, studies often\nshow that salt can be reduced by\nabout 10 per cent at a time\nwithout any significant effect on\nfood acceptability.\nThere is a limit, however, to the\nextent to which salt substitutes\ncan be used. Salt substitutes tend\nto have off-tastes such as\nbitterness, sourness, and a\n“metallic” flavour. Potassium\nchloride, for instance, can taste\nlike “salty paracetamol”.\nTo proceed beyond a simple\nreduction or limited substitute of\nsalts, other technological\nsolutions need to be developed.\nThematic research and\ndevelopment programmes –\nsimilar to those on alternative\nproteins or food security – should\nbe established.\nParticular emphasis should be\nplaced on forming consortia\nbetween institutes of higher\nlearning, research institutes and\nindustries to develop\ntechnologies and solutions that\ncan be applied to categories of\nfood.\nExamples of technological\nresearch and development\nresults include processing\nmethods that can retain flavours\nof foods or maintain microbial\nsafety, thereby reducing the need\nfor additional salt content.\nSome examples of product R&D\nresults are optimising the size and\nshape of salt particles so that they\ndissolve faster in the mouth , and\nthere is more sodium to trigger\nthe taste buds; and partitioning\nsalt to trigger a saltier taste.\nPartitioning means putting salt\nin different parts of the food. For\nexample, in soups with chicken\npieces, a higher overall salty taste\nis obtained if the salt is\nconcentrated in the pieces rather\nthan in the liquid.\nINDIVIDUAL ACTION\nIt is important that we have\ngreater awareness of the sodium\ncontent in our food. Regularly\neating food with high salt content\nis likely to condition our taste\npreferences to a higher salt level.\nIn contrast, if our taste buds are\nused to lower salt levels, we\nwould find food with low salt\ncontent more acceptable.\nA first step to take is\nconsciously choosing food with\nlower salt content, and\nrequesting no or less salt when\ngiven an option.\nWhen cooking, we can partition\nsalt content between different\ncomponents of the food – so if we\nknow that some components of\nthe food, such as sauce, already\ncontain salt, we can avoid adding\nsalt to other components – while\nenhancing the flavour of those\nthat are less salty with herbs or\nspices, or by including more\nflavourful ingredients.\nSome cooking methods, such as\nusing less water, can also\naccentuate the natural flavours of\nthe food and reduce the need to\nuse salt. Perhaps the sugar\noptions of “kosong” (zero) and\n“siu dai” (less sweet) will\neventually be adopted for salt,\ntoo.\nBy reducing our salt\nconsumption bit by bit, we will\neventually be able to attain\nsignificant reductions in our salt\nconsumption and better manage\nour risks of developing\ncardiovascular diseases.\nstopinion@sph.com.sg\n•Aaron Goh is an associate\nprofessor, engineering cluster, at\nthe Singapore Institute of\nTechnology.Research institutes, industry and\nindividual all have a part to playConsider a finer\ngrain approach\nto lower salt intakePublication: The Straits Times\nDate: 6 April 2022\nSource: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.
