The course content broke down the complexities of the technology, which involves texturising plant-based proteins into viable meat alternatives, into digestible information,” Dr Zuellig added.\nFoodPlant’s collaboration with SIT has also opened doors for SGProtein to work with young talents and tap their minds.\nLast year, SGProtein collaborated with SIT’s Food Technology students to research the value of incorporating moringa and seaweed in meat analogues. “We were involved in the student project to analyse how alternative and local ingredients could enhance nutrition, texture and flavour of the alternative meat product,” said Mr Kull.\nSGProtein is now working on the possibility of recruiting students embarking on their\nIntegrated Work Study Programme (IWSP)\nto work at their facility. Mr Kull noted that it is a win-win arrangement – the company can provide students with practical knowledge in the field, while gathering fresh ideas and insights from them.\n“I think it's very important to have such exchanges to allow students to see what they learned in university being applied in the field, and also for us to see what's the newest trend in the research side and bring that into our practical approach,” he added.\nThis article was originally published on\nSIT's Digital Newsroom\n.\nRelated Courses\nFood, Chemical and Biotechnology\nNext-Generation Food Innovation: Texture Development and Advanced Rheology\nLearn theory in mechanics, rheology and biopolymer chemistry.
