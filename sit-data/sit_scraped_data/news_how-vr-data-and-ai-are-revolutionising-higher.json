    "How VR, Data, and AI are Revolutionising Higher Education",
    "Speakers from the Applied Learning Conference 2022 share how virtual reality and games are transforming the way students learn.",
    "Picture this: there is a global infection raging across the world, and the scientist working to cure it has been infected. You are humanity’s last hope, but to develop a cure, you will need to cultivate the appropriate antibodies. Fail, and humanity will perish.",
    "Students majoring in pharmaceutical engineering are faced with the above scenario to learn how to use complex equipment necessary for their field of study – through a virtual simulation, of course. Technology is transforming the way students are learning in institutes of higher learning across the world.",
    "At the Applied Learning Conference 2022, speakers from Singapore institutions shared how tech such as virtual reality (VR) and games can help students learn better beyond the classroom.",
    "Engaging students with games",
    "Pharmaceutical engineering students in the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) learned how to use complex biopharmaceutical equipment through a gamified VR simulation.",
    "Within virtual reality, students help the protagonist to combat a global infection by growing cells and creating an antibody within the bioreactor, which is used to grow organisms under controlled conditions.",
    "The gamification techniques and science fiction storyline assist in contextualising the problem and retention of the theory, explained Associate Professor Jeannie Lee,",
    "Infocomm Technology cluster",
    ".",
    "While playing, students receive feedback on their actions and learn through both visual feedback and audio voice prompts. The learning progress is reflected at checkpoints throughout the VR simulation.",
    "Pharmaceutical engineering students in the Singapore Institute of Technology learn how to use complex biopharmaceutical equipment, including a bioreactor, through a gamified VR simulation.",
    "Students who participated in the research phase for the virtual reality simulation gave feedback that they found it fun and easy to understand, shared A/Prof Lee. They also reported that it helped improve their knowledge of the biochemistry concepts, she added.",
    "While games can be educational, there is a challenge in balancing elements of fun and learning when designing games, said Dr Linda William, a Senior Lecturer from the School of Informatics & IT at Temasek Polytechnic.",
    "Game design should always begin with the concept, skill, or knowledge that educators want students to learn, she suggested. Once that is established, educators can break down the learning outcomes, identify points of assessment, and come up with questions for each topic.",
    "These questions can then be integrated into the game, so that students who play it can walk away with the desired learning outcomes, said Dr William.",
    "Training students more effectively using VR",
    "VR can enhance learning, especially in fields like engineering and healthcare. For these industries, it is crucial to get procedures right, and cost for operations might be high, said A/Prof Lee.",
    "The VR simulation can help students learn how to use complex and expensive machinery that they have limited access to while in schools, she shared.",
    "At SIT, researchers created a 3D virtual version of an equipment called the bioreactor, which users can interact with through a VR headset. Through this simulation, students learn how to identify the components of the bioreactor, set up the machine, and cultivate cells with it.",
    "Besides interactive elements, virtual simulations can combine with practical lessons to enhance learning.",
    "A student developer demonstrates the VR simulation used by pharmaceutical engineering students in SIT.",
    "For example, educators can add informative videos into the virtual simulation to better prepare students for practical lab sessions, said Associate Professor Victor Wang,",
    "Engineering cluster",
    ", and Deputy Director at the Center for Learning Environment & Assessment Development, SIT.",
    "Additionally, virtual simulations give students equal access to a piece of equipment. For example, students may find it difficult to read finer details and information off a single device in a physical lab environment. But online, everyone can see the data clearly, A/Prof Wang explained.",
    "This overcomes the space constraints in labs, he added.",
    "While virtual simulations can help students in their learning, it is not yet a replacement for physical lab sessions, said A/Prof Wang. Like learning to drive a car, it is difficult to learn practical skills merely through virtual sessions, he shared.",
    "Conducting physical experiments firsthand also helps students understand the dangers with certain equipment and why it is important for them to follow safety procedures. “It’s not just about achieving the specific project objectives, but also about conducting the experiment safely,” he explained.",
    "Personalising learning through data and machine learning",
    "Without real-time feedback, it can be difficult for educators to track students’ progress in a virtual environment, whether it is in educational games or virtual simulations. Data and machine learning can solve this problem.",
    "While students are playing the game, relevant data is collected and analysed, said Dr William. Machine learning can then be used to find insights from their feedback, and if they are struggling with certain topics.",
    "For example, if machine learning detects negative sentiments from the students, educators can follow up with the student, she explained. Machine learning can also alert the teacher if many students are struggling with a particular topic. In such cases, educators can take steps to explain it better or focus more on that topic in lessons.",
    "Another way machine learning can help is by clustering students based on their performance. For instance, students who get many questions wrong in the game will be classified as weaker students. Educators can then follow up based on this information and provide more help to students who need it.",
    "Gone are the days of poring over textbooks and listening to teachers drone on during lectures. By integrating game and VR elements into education, students are more motivated to learn and can pick up concepts and skills in a fun and engaging way.",

You are humanity’s last hope, but to develop a cure, you will need to cultivate the appropriate antibodies. Fail, and humanity will perish.\nStudents majoring in pharmaceutical engineering are faced with the above scenario to learn how to use complex equipment necessary for their field of study – through a virtual simulation, of course. Technology is transforming the way students are learning in institutes of higher learning across the world.\nAt the Applied Learning Conference 2022, speakers from Singapore institutions shared how tech such as virtual reality (VR) and games can help students learn better beyond the classroom.\nEngaging students with games\nPharmaceutical engineering students in the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) learned how to use complex biopharmaceutical equipment through a gamified VR simulation.\nWithin virtual reality, students help the protagonist to combat a global infection by growing cells and creating an antibody within the bioreactor, which is used to grow organisms under controlled conditions.\nThe gamification techniques and science fiction storyline assist in contextualising the problem and retention of the theory, explained Associate Professor Jeannie Lee,\nInfocomm Technology cluster\n.\nWhile playing, students receive feedback on their actions and learn through both visual feedback and audio voice prompts. The learning progress is reflected at checkpoints throughout the VR simulation.\nPharmaceutical engineering students in the Singapore Institute of Technology learn how to use complex biopharmaceutical equipment, including a bioreactor, through a gamified VR simulation.\nStudents who participated in the research phase for the virtual reality simulation gave feedback that they found it fun and easy to understand, shared A/Prof Lee. They also reported that it helped improve their knowledge of the biochemistry concepts, she added.\nWhile games can be educational, there is a challenge in balancing elements of fun and learning when designing games, said Dr Linda William, a Senior Lecturer from the School of Informatics & IT at Temasek Polytechnic.\nGame design should always begin with the concept, skill, or knowledge that educators want students to learn, she suggested. Once that is established, educators can break down the learning outcomes, identify points of assessment, and come up with questions for each topic.\nThese questions can then be integrated into the game, so that students who play it can walk away with the desired learning outcomes, said Dr William.\nTraining students more effectively using VR\nVR can enhance learning, especially in fields like engineering and healthcare. For these industries, it is crucial to get procedures right, and cost for operations might be high, said A/Prof Lee.\nThe VR simulation can help students learn how to use complex and expensive machinery that they have limited access to while in schools, she shared.\nAt SIT, researchers created a 3D virtual version of an equipment called the bioreactor, which users can interact with through a VR headset. Through this simulation, students learn how to identify the components of the bioreactor, set up the machine, and cultivate cells with it.\nBesides interactive elements, virtual simulations can combine with practical lessons to enhance learning.\nA student developer demonstrates the VR simulation used by pharmaceutical engineering students in SIT.\nFor example, educators can add informative videos into the virtual simulation to better prepare students for practical lab sessions, said Associate Professor Victor Wang,\nEngineering cluster\n, and Deputy Director at the Center for Learning Environment & Assessment Development, SIT.\nAdditionally, virtual simulations give students equal access to a piece of equipment. For example, students may find it difficult to read finer details and information off a single device in a physical lab environment. But online, everyone can see the data clearly, A/Prof Wang explained.\nThis overcomes the space constraints in labs, he added.\nWhile virtual simulations can help students in their learning, it is not yet a replacement for physical lab sessions, said A/Prof Wang. Like learning to drive a car, it is difficult to learn practical skills merely through virtual sessions, he shared.\nConducting physical experiments firsthand also helps students understand the dangers with certain equipment and why it is important for them to follow safety procedures. “It’s not just about achieving the specific project objectives, but also about conducting the experiment safely,” he explained.\nPersonalising learning through data and machine learning\nWithout real-time feedback, it can be difficult for educators to track students’ progress in a virtual environment, whether it is in educational games or virtual simulations. Data and machine learning can solve this problem.\nWhile students are playing the game, relevant data is collected and analysed, said Dr William. Machine learning can then be used to find insights from their feedback, and if they are struggling with certain topics.\nFor example, if machine learning detects negative sentiments from the students, educators can follow up with the student, she explained. Machine learning can also alert the teacher if many students are struggling with a particular topic. In such cases, educators can take steps to explain it better or focus more on that topic in lessons.\nAnother way machine learning can help is by clustering students based on their performance. For instance, students who get many questions wrong in the game will be classified as weaker students. Educators can then follow up based on this information and provide more help to students who need it.\nGone are the days of poring over textbooks and listening to teachers drone on during lectures. By integrating game and VR elements into education, students are more motivated to learn and can pick up concepts and skills in a fun and engaging way.\n– – –\nThis article first appeared in\nGovInsider\n.\nTopics\nFeatures\nPharmaceutical Engineering\nFaculty\nSIT Expert Spotlight\nCATEGORIES\nAcademic Clusters\nFood, Chemical and Biotechnology\nInfocomm Technology\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nBe Part of the Sea Change\nview\nNext\nMarrying Career Aspirations and Values\nview\nRelated News\n26 Mar 2025\nPower Through Emotion\nSIT, Chemistry and Pod of Life unveil a new approach to combat workplace burnout through The Emotional Baggage Board Game.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Academic Clusters, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n18 Sep 2024\nOCBC to Invest $500 Million in Punggol Digital District\nInvestment includes a multi-million-dollar strategic partnership with SIT\ntag\nPress Releases, Industry & Community, Academic Clusters, Business, Communication and Design, Infocomm Technology\n23 Jun 2023\nHelping Mental Health Patients Lead Meaningful Lives\nCognitive remediation expert A/Prof Tan Bhing Leet was recently awarded the 2023 Connie Lieber Science to Practice Award for Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry.\ntag\nAcademic Clusters, Health and Social Sciences"
