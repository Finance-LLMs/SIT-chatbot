    "The Glasgow School of Art",
    "Note: This programme will cease to take in students from AY2020. SIT and GSA have come to a decision not to admit further students in these programmes. The graduating students of 2021 will be the final cohort of this successful partnership. However, this will not affect current students or alumni. SIT and GSA will continue to ensure that the quality of teaching remains of a high standard. The degree programmes offered by GSA will continue to be recognised in Singapore and beyond. SIT will also continue to review its overall slate of programme offerings regularly, in order to remain nimble and responsive to the constantly evolving needs of the industry and community.",
    "Interior Design involves the creation of imaginative and stimulating environments in specific places — often within existing buildings. The revitalisation, reuse and re-imagining of the latter require a sensitivity to the particular qualities of a site and host building, along with an understanding of the needs of the people who will populate it.",
    "In proposing fresh ways people might use a building, a skilled interior designer is able to creatively embrace the constraints of brief and context, engaging in a dialogue between existing architectural form, and contemporary approaches to the organisation, detailing, and decoration of a space.",
    "Intelligent interior design is a key contributor to an improved quality of life, and it helps generate business success. It has an established professional structure which allows graduates the opportunity to gain invaluable experience at various levels of responsibility before choosing to set up in independent practice or take leading roles in established studios.",
    "The Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Interior Design is validated by the University of Glasgow, a member of the prestigious Russell Group of leading UK research universities and a founder member of Universitas 21, an international grouping of universities dedicated to setting worldwide standards for higher education.",

    "Overseas Immersion Programme",
    "All students will have to complete a 4-week attachment at the home campus of Glasgow School of the Arts in the UK.  Students will experience life as a GSA student in Glasgow and be taken through a series of lectures and a credit-bearing studio design project, which is aimed at enhancing the students’ critical awareness and practical capabilities in design thinking and production.  The immersion experience, inclusive of visits to key cultural sites and institutions in the city of Glasgow will help students acquire a critical understanding of the global practice of design.",
    "The estimated cost of the overseas immersion programme ranges from S$4,500 to S$5,500.",
    "Note: Estimated costs are dependent on prevailing currency exchange rates and flight ticket prices.",
