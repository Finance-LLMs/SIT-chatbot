    "Bachelor of Business in Hospitality and Tourism Management",
    ".",
    "The Bachelor of Hospitality Business with Honours is a direct honours degree programme; the first and only hospitality business degree programme offered by an autonomous university in Singapore.",
    "The programme aims to nurture hospitality professionals who are passionate about making positive and tangible contributions to the industry. In fulfilling industry needs, they will, at the same time, be competitive and forward-looking. Graduates of Hospitality Business can, therefore, expect to develop strong operational skills (know-how) anchored in solid theoretical knowledge (know-why). They will also acquire strong cultural sensitivity and critical thinking skills in line with the international nature of Singapore’s hospitality scene.",
    "Curriculum",
    "Students can expect a curriculum that combines theory and current industry practices. This will be taught against the backdrop of a Singapore-oriented context with industry specialisations in Hotel & Integrated Resort, Event & Entrepreneurship, and Travel & Tourism. With a strong and diverse faculty possessing worldwide hospitality industry experience, classroom learning will be complemented by international practical applications and best practices.",
    "A key component of our curriculum is the Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP). Through this, students will work as employees of hospitality organisations to integrate real experience with classroom knowledge. As an applied learning platform, IWSP is envisioned to culminate in students becoming “Thinking Tinkerers” – by identifying hospitality issues for which they can develop innovative solutions through the Capstone module, i.e. an applied research project.",
    "Career Opportunities",
    "Hospitality Business graduates will be well-poised for positions in a myriad of hospitality organisations in Singapore and beyond. A sample of these includes hotels, integrated resorts, MICE companies, tourism and hospitality consulting firms, tourism bureaus, food and beverage establishments, hotel management companies, cruise lines, tourist attractions, airlines and airports.",

    "Integrated Work Study Programme",
    "Integrated Work Study Programme provides students with the opportunity to undertake real work. Held over the span of eight months, it is designed to be more in-depth than a traditional internship. You will gain real work experience and apply the theories you learn in class with actual practice.",
