    "Going Green for Green Mark Challenge",
    "A team of SITizens bagged the first runner-up spot in the",
    "BCA BiG Club Green Mark Challenge 2019",
    ". Held on 23 February, the challenge was organised by the Build it Green (BiG) Club, initiated by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to promote awareness and knowledge of the green culture in the built environment among youths in Singapore.",
    "For the Challenge, teams had to propose additional innovative green features for Sim Lim Square’s future building in Jurong, for it to achieve Green Mark GoldPlus status and above. Participants could choose to redesign the building and green features to achieve the goals while keeping in mind feasibility of ideas and site features.",
    "The SIT Team (seated from left to right: Harvest, Aaron, Justin and Garrett) presenting their ideas to the judge Ms Wendy Li from BCA (seated, centre).",
    "“The challenge was a good opportunity for us to learn more about the BCA Green Mark Scheme and propose creative yet implementable ideas to promote sustainability in the built environment,” said team leader Justin Seah, Year 1 student reading BEng (Hon) in Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services). “The competition was tough as we were the only Year One students amidst 15 teams of seniors from other autonomous universities. Thanks to guidance from our mentor Assistant Professor Steven Kardinal Jusuf, we were able to apply what we have learnt in the classroom to this competition.”",
    "Justin and his team mates, Garrett Ong, Harvest Yosua Purwono and Aaron Wong, came up with initiatives that were deemed not only eco-friendly but also sustainable from a business point of view. This means more savings in terms of energy and costs. One of the solutions proposed was the implementation of an energy management system that emphasizes the use of renewable energy. This included the use of regenerative lifts, carbon monoxide sensors and motion sensors, as well as installation of solar panels. The team also looked into improving the water efficiency, environmental protection, and indoor air quality of the building. They suggested ideas such as using NEWater for cooling tower consumption, implementing recycling efforts and ensuring the cleanliness of the building ventilation system.",
    "The SITizens with one of the judges, Mr Tan Szue Hann (second from right), Managing Director, MINIWIZ Singapore.",
    "“One of the judges, Mr Tan Szue Hann from MINIWIZ Singapore, was not only impressed with our students' presentation, but also by their innovative ideas and Building Information Modelling (BIM) model that they did up for the competition in a short period of time,” commented Assistant Professor Steven Kardinal Jusuf.",
    "Our heartiest congratulations to the SITizens!",
    "The SITizens won second prize and $200 shopping vouchers in the Challenge.",

Held on 23 February, the challenge was organised by the Build it Green (BiG) Club, initiated by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to promote awareness and knowledge of the green culture in the built environment among youths in Singapore.\nFor the Challenge, teams had to propose additional innovative green features for Sim Lim Square’s future building in Jurong, for it to achieve Green Mark GoldPlus status and above. Participants could choose to redesign the building and green features to achieve the goals while keeping in mind feasibility of ideas and site features.\nThe SIT Team (seated from left to right: Harvest, Aaron, Justin and Garrett) presenting their ideas to the judge Ms Wendy Li from BCA (seated, centre).\n“The challenge was a good opportunity for us to learn more about the BCA Green Mark Scheme and propose creative yet implementable ideas to promote sustainability in the built environment,” said team leader Justin Seah, Year 1 student reading BEng (Hon) in Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services). “The competition was tough as we were the only Year One students amidst 15 teams of seniors from other autonomous universities. Thanks to guidance from our mentor Assistant Professor Steven Kardinal Jusuf, we were able to apply what we have learnt in the classroom to this competition.”\nJustin and his team mates, Garrett Ong, Harvest Yosua Purwono and Aaron Wong, came up with initiatives that were deemed not only eco-friendly but also sustainable from a business point of view. This means more savings in terms of energy and costs. One of the solutions proposed was the implementation of an energy management system that emphasizes the use of renewable energy. This included the use of regenerative lifts, carbon monoxide sensors and motion sensors, as well as installation of solar panels. The team also looked into improving the water efficiency, environmental protection, and indoor air quality of the building. They suggested ideas such as using NEWater for cooling tower consumption, implementing recycling efforts and ensuring the cleanliness of the building ventilation system.\nThe SITizens with one of the judges, Mr Tan Szue Hann (second from right), Managing Director, MINIWIZ Singapore.\n“One of the judges, Mr Tan Szue Hann from MINIWIZ Singapore, was not only impressed with our students' presentation, but also by their innovative ideas and Building Information Modelling (BIM) model that they did up for the competition in a short period of time,” commented Assistant Professor Steven Kardinal Jusuf.\nOur heartiest congratulations to the SITizens!\nThe SITizens won second prize and $200 shopping vouchers in the Challenge.\nTopics\nSustainability\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nEngineering\nAcademic Clusters\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nA Lean Way to Address Industry Problems\nview\nNext\nMapletree Brings Challenge to Budding Entrepreneurs at SIT\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
