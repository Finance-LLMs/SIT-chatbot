    "Electricity is at the heart of modern economic development. Industry and buildings account for over 90% of global electricity demand today.",
    "Global electricity demand is set to grow, underpinned by the electrification of transport and the rapid pace of digitalisation of the modern economy. Electrical installations are traditionally designed and erected to provide for safety and proper functioning for the intended use. The sustainable development scenario and the digital economy mandate that electrical installation design must emphasise energy efficiency and supply resilience. After commissioning, subsequent operation and maintenance activities will require energy audit and monitoring to sustain energy efficient management of the facilities.",
    "IEC 60364-8-1:2019 considers various factors that affect efficiency in electrical installations and the consumption of electrical energy. The optimisation of the use of electricity is based on energy efficiency management which is dependent on the price of electricity, electrical consumption and real-time adaptation. Efficiency is checked and improved by measurement during the life cycle of the electrical installations.",
    "The main objectives of this 40-hour training programme are to enable participants to:",
    "Gain in-depth knowledge of the safety and functional design requirements of electrical installations",
