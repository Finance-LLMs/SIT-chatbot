    "How does stacking to SIT's Master of Health Sciences work?",
    "Our Graduate Certificate in Medical Sonography includes one core module and two specialist modules (also known as Discipline Electives). These modules are also components of the Master of Health Sciences programme. By completing the Graduate Certificate, you can transition into the Master of Health Sciences programme and apply these credits towards earning the MHSc degree.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Are the modules conducted full-time or part-time? Am I able to continue working if the module is full-time?",
    "Both full-time and part-time modes are available.",
    "For the part-time mode, each module will be delivered using blended learning pedagogy (hybrid of online learning and flexible workshop scheduling) for adult learners.",
    "Candidates who are pursuing the full-time mode are required to have access to a medical ultrasound facility and clock in at least 3 days/week of clinical experience at the clinical site to fulfil the clinical requirement. This is important to develop the necessary technical, clinical, and diagnostic skills during the candidature.",
    "Candidates undertaking the full-time mode can take more than one module (up to a maximum of 3 modules) in the same trimester. However, during the course of study, candidates who are pursuing the full-time mode are required to have adequate access to clinical work to fulfill the clinical development.",
    "Candidates must complete logging the required number of clinical scans in the portfolio and develop competency in the respective clinical applications. They must be actively engaged in a supervised ultrasound clinical practice in the workplace.",
    "At the end of the trimester, candidates must satisfy the clinical requirements (i.e., compulsory logging of the required number of ultrasound examinations in the clinical portfolio and passing the clinical skills assessment).",
    "chevron--up",
    "Is AHPC a compulsory requirement for Medical Sonography modules?",
    "The AHPC requirement is preferred but not a compulsory entry criterion for the Graduate Certificate in Medical Sonography.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Am I allowed to take more modules concurrently to complete the course within a shorter time span?",
    "It is possible to take all modules offered within the same trimester. The module timings are scheduled not to overlap.",
    "Acceptance is granted at the sole discretion of SIT",
    "LEARN.",
    "chevron--up",
    "How will the modules be conducted?",
    "Classes are conducted in the day or in the evenings, after office hours. Additionally, candidates must allocate time for self-study, developing clinical portfolio, participating in online discussions, completing continual assessments, and preparing for a final exam.",
    "chevron--up",
    "How will the candidates be graded for the modules?",
    "Each module may vary slightly, but all will include continual assessments followed by a final exam.",
