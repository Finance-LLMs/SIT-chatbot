Projects\nwhich achieve greater carbon abate-\nment will receive more support.From Apr 1, the grant applica-\ntion and disbursement process will\nalso be made easier to help applic-\nants save both time and costs.\nCompanies are encouraged to\ntap low-cost energy assessments\noffered by the Energy Efficiency\nTechnology Centre (EETC), a collab-\noration between the NEA and Singa-\npore Institute of Technology (SIT).\nBoth  organisations  are  now\nworking on the next phase of the\nEETC: developing manpower capab-\nilities in energy efficiency. This in-\ncludes a new training-and-simula-\ntion centre where skills can be\nlearnt and practised in a controlled\nand safe environment, while replic-\nating real-world conditions.\nSeparately, S$220 million has\nbeen allocated to drive new initiat-\nives in water technologies and re-\nsource circularity – that is, reusing\nand recycling resources – under the\nurban solutions and sustainability domain of the national Research, In-\nnovation and Enterprise 2025 plan\n(RIE2025).\nOf this, S$80 million will go to-\nwards a new Closing the Resource\nLoop funding initiative. This will\nfund research and development\n(R&D) on sustainable resource re-\ncovery solutions for key waste\nstreams including e-waste, plastics\nand food, as well as finding useful\nand safe applications for treated\nwaste residues.\nAnother S$87 million was alloc-\nated for 3 water technology areas:\ndesalination and water reuse; used\nwater treatment; and waste reduc-\ntion and resource recovery. This is\nfor R&D at the Nanyang Environ-\nment and Water Research Institute\n(NEWRI) and the Separation Techno-\nlogies Applied Research and Trans-\nlation (Start).\nThe remaining amount of the\nS$220 million figure was allocated to the Competitive Funding for Wa-\nter Research programme last year.\nBeyond meeting national needs,\n“research and innovation will also\nbe an engine for green growth, spur-\nring private sector R&D spending,\njob creation and technology spin-\noffs in the water industry and adja-\ncent sectors”, said Fu.\nUnder RIE2025, Start will also\ncommission a new desalination in-\ntegrated validation plant in 2023.\nThis will “trial promising technolo-\ngies to reduce the energy consump-\ntion of desalination to less than\n2 kWh per cubic metre of water”\nand pave the way for these to be im-\nplemented  in  full-scale  plants,\nshe said.\nMeanwhile, 26 more projects\nwere awarded S$2.6 million in the\nSG Eco Fund’s second grant call, for\na total of S$2.9 million for 68 pro-\njects. The fund supports ground-\nup sustainability initiatives.More  support  for  energy-efficient  tech;\nS$220m  for  R&D  in  water,  sustainability\nSource: The Business Times © SPH Media Limited.
