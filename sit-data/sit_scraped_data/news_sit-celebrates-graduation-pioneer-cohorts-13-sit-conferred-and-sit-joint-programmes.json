The main session to be held tomorrow at The Theatre at Mediacorp will be graced by Guest of Honour Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for National Development and Second Minister for Finance.\nThe SIT Graduation Ceremony 2019 marks several records. First, a record 1,868 graduates will receive their degree scrolls this year, including 1,401 from SIT-conferred degrees and SIT-overseas university (OU) degrees, and 467 from degrees conferred by SIT’s OU partners\n[1]\n. The university will also see a record number of 13 degree programmes with 372 pioneer graduates this year.\nPioneer Graduates in 13 SIT and SIT-OU Joint Degree Programmes\nThe pioneer cohorts are from the following degree programmes:\nDegree Programme\nNo. of Graduates\nSIT-conferred\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Telematics (Intelligent Transportation Systems Engineering)\n41\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Pharmaceutical Engineering\n77\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (SIE) (Building Services)\n63\nMaster of Engineering Technology (MEngTech) in Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (SIE) (Building Services)\n17\nMaster of Engineering Technology (MEngTech) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering\n1\nSIT-Massey University\nBachelor of Food Technology with Honours\n49\nSIT-DigiPen Institute of Technology\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Systems Engineering (ElectroMechanical Systems)\n22\nSIT-Newcastle University\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Chemical Engineering\n52\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Electrical Power Engineering\n27\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering\n15\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Marine Engineering\n11\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Naval Architecture\n6\nBachelor of Engineering (BEng) with Honours in Offshore Engineering\n8\nAll graduates from SIT-conferred and SIT-OU joint degrees completed the university’s signature Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) as part of their curriculum requirements. Key to SIT’s applied learning approach, the IWSP requires students to undertake six- to 12-month long work attachments, thereby allowing them to integrate theory and practice and develop deep specialist skills in their chosen fields. The IWSP is structured uniquely for each degree programme, catering to the specific needs of each industry to develop industry-ready graduates.\nThe Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (SIE-Building Services) programme, launched in 2015, is the first of its kind in Singapore, offering highly-specialised training for the built environment sector. Graduates who are seeking to be a Chartered Engineer or Professional Engineer have an option to undergo an additional year in the programme to graduate with a Master of Engineering Technology (MEngTech).\nOne graduate who completed both BEng and MEngTech in\nSIE (Building Services)\nis\nLoh Jun Han\n, who is also the valedictorian of the graduation ceremony. He served his one-year IWSP in Tiong Seng Contractors Pte Ltd, an experience which enhanced his knowledge of the building and construction industry and prepared him well for work upon graduation. Jun Han joined global urban and infrastructure consultancy Surbana Jurong in January 2019 as a Computational Specialist, while pursuing his eight-month MEngTech programme, which required him to attend evening classes for four nights every week. Jun Han also represented SIT in various competitions, such as the BCA-CDL Green Spark Competition 2016, where he clinched a Merit award, as well as the regional Air Liquide Data Science Challenge 2018, where he achieved top 10 ranking. For his stellar academic achievements, Jun Han was awarded the Golden Jubilee Scholarship and BCA-Industry Built Environment Undergraduate Sponsorship during his studies.\nMarilyn Tan\n, a pioneer graduate of the\nTelematics (Intelligent Transportation Systems Engineering)\nprogramme, recently embarked on her full-time job as a Software Engineer with ST Engineering. Armed with a Diploma in Telematics and Media Technology from Nanyang Polytechnic, she chose to further hone her skills at SIT, as it was the only local university offering a degree in Telematics. Marilyn was drawn to how Telematics could enable her to contribute to future technologies, and was also interested in the eight-month work attachment that the programme offers. Her IWSP at Accenture challenged Marilyn to think fast and be resourceful, preparing her for what real work should be. She has since joined ST Engineering as a Software Engineer.\nAnother SITizen who has benefitted immensely from her IWSP is\nNg Xin Hui\n, a pioneer graduate of the\nPharmaceutical Engineering\nprogramme. Her eight-month work attachment at Pfizer Singapore exposed her to various tasks entrusted to full-time engineers, and the stint allowed Xin Hui to grasp processes in a real-work setting. Her excellent performance and tinkering mindset impressed Pfizer to offer her full-time employment upon completion of her studies. She is currently a Process Engineer at the company.\nStrengthening Relationship with OU Partners\nSIT’s strong ties with reputable OUs allow SIT to offer a world-class education that aims to expand students’ global perspectives. The curricula of joint degree programmes are designed to address the needs of Singapore’s economy, while retaining the global outlook offered by the OU partners, thereby endowing students the best of both worlds.\nOne graduate who has benefitted from a joint programme is\nEyrica Lee Min Wei\n, a pioneer of the\nSystems Engineering (ElectroMechanical Systems) (SEEMS)\nprogramme. Jointly offered by SIT and DigiPen Institute of Technology, the SEEMS programme was Eyrica’s first choice as she recognised that the degree would equip her with the skills necessary to stay adaptable in the complex and evolving engineering industry. The programme’s partnership with DigiPen allowed her to undertake a three-month immersive summer programme at DigiPen’s main campus in Washington, USA, where she attended lectures specially curated for SIT-DigiPen students. The experience enhanced her global outlook through cross-cultural exchanges. Eyrica was also the first recipient of the Dual Studies Industry Sponsorship Pioneer Programme in 2015, which is a local version of the German dual studies model in SIT, jointly offered by the Economic Development Board and her sponsoring company, Uhlmann Singapore LLP. Following her one-year work attachment at Uhlmann, Eyrica was offered a full-time job and is now a Designer there. Adding to her list of achievements, Eyrica was also one of the five SEEMS students who have passed their systems engineering knowledge examination for the INCOSE (International Council on Systems Engineering) certification, and is now a qualified INCOSE Associate Systems Engineering Professional (ASEP).\nAnother graduate who was offered full-time position at her IWSP company is\nLoh Hui Lin\n, a pioneer graduate from the\nFood Technology\nprogramme jointly offered by SIT and Massey University. While she was in polytechnic, Hui Lin recognised Massey’s distinguished reputation in food research, and was drawn to SIT’s industry-focused pedagogy. She applied for the joint programme in 2016, and had since shone in her higher education pursuit. Her IWSP employer, Thong Siek Global, a leading manufacturer of seafood products, was impressed with Hui Lin’s dedication and can-do attitude, and offered her a full-time job upon completion of her studies. Hui Lin is now a Food Technologist there.\nSIT’s longstanding partnership with Newcastle University (NU) continued to strengthen in 2017, when seven of the latter’s engineering degrees evolved into joint programmes offered by both SIT and NU.\nRenee Ho\n, a pioneer graduate of the\nNaval Architecture\ndegree, worked for four years as a Weapon Control Systems Operator in the Republic of Singapore Navy, on a scholarship bond after her diploma. She picked the SIT-NU programme as her first choice as she was drawn to NU’s reputable and well-structured curriculum and SIT’s close nexus with the industry. She applied what she had learnt on software modelling, calculations and reviews on structural and stability aspects of vessels in real-work projects during her six-month IWSP at Bureau Veritas Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd. The company hired Renee as a Plan Approval Engineer (Naval Architect) upon completion of her degree programme.\nMuhammad Firdaus bin Fawzi Laza\nalso shares the sentiments of having benefitted from the strong partnership between SIT and NU. The pioneer graduate of BEng (Hons) in\nElectrical Power Engineering\nrecognised that real-work experience would give him an edge as a graduate, and cited SIT’s applied learning approach and IWSP as his deciding factors. His six-month IWSP at ST Telemedia Global Data Centres as a Critical Infrastructure Specialist proved to be a valuable experience as he got to apply what he learnt. He also shared that the three-week Overseas Immersion Programme helped to widen his perspectives as he got the opportunity to participate in industry site visits and observe best practices. Currently pursuing the full-time Master of Engineering Technology in Electrical and Electronic Engineering programme at SIT, Firdaus looks forward to playing an integral role in helping Singapore be more energy efficient. He has secured a scholarship with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and will be serving his bond upon completion of his Masters programme.\nSIT Graduates Well Sought After by Employers\nIn a preliminary survey\n[2]\nof the Class of 2019 conducted by SIT, about 80% of graduates among four pioneer SIT-conferred and SIT-joint degree programmes have secured jobs. In particular, 95% of SIE (Building Services) graduates are in employment following the completion of their studies.\nSaid Professor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT, “To stay relevant in this era of economic transformation, higher education in Singapore needs to keep up with changing industry needs. The IWSP has provided our students with real work opportunities that allow them to face the challenges of the current economy, and develop skills of adaptability, creativity and innovation, while adding value to the workplace. I am heartened to note that the IWSP has proven to help our SITizens secure employment, some even before their graduation.\nIn line with the SIT-DNA that encourages SITizens to embrace a lifelong learning mindset, all SIT graduates are given S$2,000 worth of credits each to embark on eligible courses offered by SIT\nLEARN\nProfessional Development, SIT’s Lifelong Learning division.
