    "The application of fire engineering science is essential in safeguarding lives and minimising risk associated with fire hazards in the built environment.",
    "Fire Engineering Science forms a fundamental pillar in the development of fire safety engineering. It integrates principles from engineering, physics, chemistry, and human behaviour to develop comprehensive and effective fire safety solutions tailored to modern architectural and infrastructural designs. Its significance is reflected in numerous iconic and complex structures in Singapore, including the Esplanade, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, the rail networks, and large-scale integrated developments. These structures showcase how fire engineering science is applied to manage risk without compromising architectural ambition or functionality.",
    "This course equips learners with the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics and their application to fire behaviour analysis. They will explore the principles of fire chemistry and physics, study the mechanisms of heat transfer and flame spread, and examine how gases and fluids behave during fire incidents.",

    "Cheong Meng is a Principal Risk Consultant with more than 35 years of experience in process safety and risk consultancy in the petrochemical industry. He has worked for several major companies in the areas of engineering and operations with responsibilities in process engineering design, HDPE plant construction, commissioning and operation, production of metal finishing products, and management of poison chemicals.",
    "Additionally, he has played a pivotal role in conducting process safety studies, encompassing activities like Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA), Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP), Safety Integrity Level (SIL) Classification and Verification, and Fire and Gas Detectors Mapping. His proficiency extends to tasks such as safety case preparation, audits, and the development of reliability diagrams. He has also contributed to roadmap studies for digitising process safety information systems and conducted user requirements analysis for real-time emergency response systems utilised by industrial chemical complexes.",
