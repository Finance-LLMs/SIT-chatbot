    "chevron--up",
    "What are the fees and charges that are allowed under the PSEA usage for the repayment of Government Loan and Financing Schemes?",
    "PSEA can be used to repay the principal loan amount, and any interest charged in respect of the loan or financing scheme that is payable by the PSEA account holder as part of the outstanding loan.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Can I use my PSEA to pay for my loans while I am still studying?",
    "No, PSEA holders must have already left the institution, as students who are still studying in the institution can use their PSEA to pay for their current fees and charges.",
    "chevron--up",
    "What is the reason for expanding the usage of PSEA fund to allow repayment of Government Loan and Financing Schemes?",
    "Some PSEA holders may have unutilised PSEA balances which they wish to use to repay the loans that they have taken during their studies, to help reduce their financial obligation. Hence, the use of PSEA is extended to allow for this.",
    "chevron--up",
    "I do not have sufficient funds in my PSEA. Can I use my siblings' PSEA to pay for loans taken by me?",
    "No. you can only use your own PSEA funds to repay your loans.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Is there a minimum repayment amount for using PSEA?",
    "For the Government education loans (i.e. TFL, SL, OSP), the minimum repayment amount for each transaction is $100. Hence, the minimum withdrawal amount from PSEA to repay the outstanding government loan is $100 for each loan. However, if your PSEA balance or total outstanding loan amount per loan is less than $100, repayment of less than $100 using PSEA is allowed. For CPF Education Scheme, there is no minimum repayment amount required for each transaction. Hence, there is no minimum withdrawal amount stipulated for using PSEA to repay the CPF Education Loan. For PSEA account holders who wish to use PSEA for loan repayments, they can opt to either fully utilise the PSEA balance to settle the outstanding loan amounts, or specify a specific amount to use for the loan repayment. The funds deducted from the PSEA will be considered as a partial capital repayment. It will not affect the monthly instalment deduction that the PSEA account holder has pre-established for monthly loan repayment. That is, the monthly instalment amount will continue to be deducted from your account in the month you have used PSEA to partially offset your outstanding loan.",
    "chevron--up",
    "How do I apply for the withdrawal of the PSEA for repayment of Government Loan and Financing Schemes?",
    "Please go to the MOE PSEA website at",
    "https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/post-secondary/post-secondary-education-account/usage",
    "to download a copy of the Loan Repayment Application form and make a hardcopy submission to MOE directly. If there are multiple loans to be repaid, MOE will effect the transfer of the PSEA balance for loan repayment in the order specified in the application form. The loans may also not be all paid in the same month. Interest will continue to accrue for your loan during this processing period, and until the loan is fully repaid.",
    "chevron--up",
    "How long will it take to process my PSEA withdrawal request and for the amount to be transferred to the loan administering agency (e.g. agent bank, institution, CPF Board)? Will interest continue to accrue during the processing period?",
    "The completed and accurate loan application form should reach MOE by the 20th of the month for MOE to repay the loan administering agency in the following month.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Can I apply for PSEA fund to be used to cover the loan amounts which I had repaid earlier and get a reimbursement from the PSEA?",
    "No. PSEA funds cannot be used for loans or amounts that had already been paid. PSEA account holder can only use their PSEA funds to pay for their outstanding loan amounts.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Are the Bursaries/Grants repayable?",
    "No, recipients are typically not required to repay Bursaries/Grants. However, the award quantum must be returned in part or in full if you either withdraw or are terminated from your studies at SIT.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Do I have to renew my Higher Education Community Bursary or Higher Education Bursary yearly?",
    "Each Higher Education Community Bursary or Higher Education Bursary award is valid for 1 Academic Year. Hence, previous recipients of the bursary will become eligible to re-apply in the following Academic Year.",
    "chevron--up",
    "I heard that there are 4 different quanta for the public bursaries, how will I know which one I am eligible to receive?",
    "There are two tiers of bursaries, the Higher Education Community Bursary or Higher Education Bursary, each with 2 sub-tiers. All four provide a different quantum. The actual award of the Public Bursary is based on the individual applicant’s Residency and assessed Per Capita Income (PCI) or Gross Household Income (GHI), whichever will accord the student the higher Public Bursary quantum. You will be informed of the exact quantum awarded to you through email notification of the application outcome.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Can I hold more than one bursary concurrently?",
    "SIT aims to provide financial assistance to as many needy students as possible. Concurrent holding of two or more Bursary/Grant awards is subjected to approval on a case by case basis.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Can I hold a combination of bursaries and scholarships concurrently?",
    "This is possible, provided the Terms & Conditions of both awards permit the concurrent holding of awards. At the point of acceptance of the bursary or scholarship award, all awardees are expected to declare their agreement to abide by this condition. If a student is found to have accepted two awards which do not permit concurrent holding of other awards, he or she would have to relinquish one award or refund the monies already granted under one of the awards.",
    "chevron--up",
    "What is the processing time for the public and private bursaries?",
    "The public bursaries (Higher Education Community Bursary or Higher Education Bursary) require at least 2-3 months processing time before submission for approval to the respective bursary awarders. The processing time for private bursaries varies as the assessment process includes interviews for shortlisted applicants before recommendations are made to the awarding organisation.",
    "chevron--up",
    "How is the Bursary/Grant disbursed to successful applicants?",
    "The disbursement of the award differs for each bursary, depending on the designated use for education expenses, tuition fees, OIP or other expenses. Awardees may receive the funds directly from the bursary awarders or via SIT. These funds could be disbursed to the student via cheque or be used to deduct/offset outstanding school fees. Students will be informed of the different outcomes accordingly.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Can the study grant be used for other school-related expenses besides paying tuition fees?",
    "The decision on how the study grant should be utilised depends on the options for use stipulated by the awarding organisations.",

    "There are so many private bursaries available, how do I know which ones to apply for? What are the chances of success for my application?",
    "You may approach the Admissions team for advice on the requirements of the different bursaries before applying. Success of the application depends on whether the eligibility criteria and expectations of the Bursary/Grant sponsors/donors are met.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Why is the application statement required?",
    "The statement applicants submit forms an important part to assess a student's application holistically. It helps the Financial Assistance Team understand the applicant better and match them to the right financial assistance.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Would my property type affect my Financial Aid (FA) Application outcome?",
    "Property type/ownership does not affect a student's eligibility for the Public Bursaries. Property type/ownership may be taken into account in determining student's eligibility for the various Donated bursaries/grants.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Would I be eligible to receive a public bursary with a larger quantum if there is a drop in my Per Capita Income (PCI)?",
    "Yes, students may be eligible to receive a public bursary with a larger quantum within the same Academic Year if there is a drop in their PCI or Gross Household Income (GHI). As there are 2 FA application cycles, students are welcome to submit applications through both cycles and if he/she is assessed to be eligible for a public bursary with a larger quantum within the same Academic Year, SIT will credit a top-up of the monies directly to the student. If students were to miss the FA application cycle, they are welcome to contact the Financial Assistance team to appeal for the public bursary with a larger quantum or any other FA  that might be available, subject to fulfilment of the eligibility criteria.",
    "chevron--up",
    "How would I be informed of my Financial Aid Application outcome?",
    "Matriculated students are typically informed through email notifications sent to their SIT student email accounts. Students will be notified of their FA application regardless of the outcome, i.e. rejection (incomplete application), rejection (income exceed), successful/unsuccessful award, etc.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Where can I obtain more information on the bursaries and grants available?",
    "Please refer",
