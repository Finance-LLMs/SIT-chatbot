The innovation\ncentres include the Design Factory@SIT (DF@SIT), the Rapid Product Innovation and Development (RaPID) Centre, the SIT-Poly\nInnovation Centre of Excellence (SPICE), and the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (NAM IC) Hub@SIT.\nIndustry\nProblem\nStatemeids lnnoHub\nA one-stop centre for industry innovation\nDesign Factory@SIT .. • Design thinking\n• Ideation & solutioning\n• Innovation training\nN/\\MiC �4,(Ks·-\"\"' .. � ...\n• Design for Additive Manufacturing\n(DfAM)\nStudents\nInterdisciplinary\nTeams Applied Research\nCentres (ARC) at\nSIT m-_:'\\Rsf!!;!J\n• Rapid prototyping\n• Minimum Viable Products (MVP)\n• Sample product development\nSPICE\n•Solutioning for industry\n•Collaboration with Poly COis�\nTechnology, Innovation\nand Enterprise (TIE)\nCentres at Polys Academic Staff\nSpecialized\nDomains\nCompleme ntary suite of expertise, skillsets & facilities to support industry innovation.

Through design innovation and experimentation, DF@SIT co-creates unique value propositions\nwith companies to improve their business models, p1 oducts, processes, designs and/or services.\nMeanwhile, the Rapid Product Innovation and Development (RaPID) Centre offers speedy and flexible prototyping and sample product\ndevelopment capabilities. For example, it recently collabo,at ecl with a local company to develop a solution to dete, birds from picking\nfood scraps off dustbins. The RaPID centre provided core capabilities in engineering design, systems integration and iterative\ndevelopment to enhance the realisation of the idea. Further refinements to the prototype were made until it was proven workable for\nscaling up.\nLikewise, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (NAMIC) Hub@SIT will co-develop advanced additive manufacturing\n(such as 30 printing) technologies fo1 industry test-bedding and adoption. NAMIC offers a range of services including AI-driven\ngenerative designs, structural topology optimisation and pilot production to enable the industry to innovate with speed and efficiency.\nThe SIT-Poly Innovation Centre of Excellence (SPICE) provides small and medium-sized enterprises (SM Es) with access to expertise,\nfacilities and equipment, and a diverse talent pool within SIT and across the various Centres of Innovation at the Polytechnics to help\nthem develop new products and services. Tapping on SIT's and the Polytechnics' existing resources reduces the risks associated with\nearly-stage investments, and allows them to focus on creating the right products for the right problems.\nCompanies can engage the  innovation centres as required. A recent example saw both DF@SIT and RaPID Centre collaborating with a\nlogistics company to design and develop an improved climate-controlled storage unit. Such storage solutions have been invaluable  for\nstoring medications and food supplies amid the global supply chain disruption challenges.\nDriving innovation in an open ecosystem, InnoHub also extends its network of innovation partners to include SIT's Applied Research\nCentres and other external collaborators. Leveraging  this, InnoHub coordinates the required resources and capabilities to undertake\nmore extensive and multi-disciplinary  projects with industry, traversing  across the  ecosystem's value chain.\nCompanies can reach out to the team at innohub@s ingaporetech.edu.sg to innovate or attend structured innovation programmes.\nFor the full story, please visit SIT's Digital Newsroom.

Seven Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) were inked with AIA Singapore , DBS\nBank, Infosys, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), Prudential Singapore, Standard Chartered Bank and United Overseas Bank\n(UOB).\nThe partnerships signify their support to jointly develop cun ent and future talents through a numbe1 of initiatives that cut across both\nPre-Employment Training (PET) and Continuing Education and Training (CET).\nDeepening Undergraduates'  Learning Opportunities\nLaunched in partnership with the Infocomm Media Development Autho1 ity (IMDA) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the\nthree-year BSc AC (Fintech) degree programme trains students in both technical skills and financial domain knowledge to position them\nfor careers in high-growth financial technology areas. As a Work-Study Degree, the programme features an enriching 16-month work\nattachment over three yea1s under the 'Term-In-Term-Out' (TITO) model. Students will alternate between spending one to two\ntrimesters in university and at the workplace.\nThrough the MOU, SIT and the seven companies will co-develop the deg1ee programme and enable work attachments and learning\nopportunities through the Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) and industrial projects. There will also be various opportunities for\nSIT students and faculty to participate in Fin tech projects, where they will collaborate with industry partners to deliver integrated\nsolutions that address business challenges.\nLifelong Learning through Workplace Learning Opportunities\nIn addition to enhancing undergraduates' learning, SIT and the companies will augment in-employment learners' upskilling through\nworkplace learning. The entities will explore programmes that include specialised training for professionals to keep up to date with the\nlatest technologies, trends and practices\nThe War for Talent - An Insider's Perspective\nThe MOU signing ceremony was followed by an insightful talk on fintech talent acquisition and retention by Ms Gill Rees, Global Head of\nHR for Transformation, Technology and Operations, Standard Chartered Bank.in the financial sector.\nFor the full story, please go to SIT Digital Newsroom."
