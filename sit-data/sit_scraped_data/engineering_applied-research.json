    "Bridging the gap between knowledge discovery and application",
    "Complementing SIT’s applied learning approach is our applied research that focuses on creating solutions for contemporary issues, and implementing them in industry settings.",
    "SIT focuses on working with the industry on translational research and innovation, spanning technology readiness levels (TRLs) 3-7. Unlike traditional research which is discovery-oriented, applied research projects have higher TRLs which bridge the gap between theoretical research and industry applications.",
    "The applied research efforts of the Engineering cluster are centred around the following pillars:",
    "1. Infrastructure (Maintenance Focus)",
    "Our applied research in infrastructure aims to develop and maintain an intelligent, resilient, and sustainable rail, marine and air transportation network to meet the long-term needs of Singapore.",
    "The purpose is to realise the optimal life-cycle asset values of the infrastructure - both new and existing - while meeting their expected operational requirements. Areas of focus include resilient infrastructure, preventive, predictive and maintenance engineering, and the use of technologies such as data analytics, AI and robotics for predictive and maintenance of critical infrastructure.",
    "2. Sustainability (Built Environment Focus)",
    "A sustainable built environment is circular and designed for resilience against future climate risks. It is important to be able to predict and mitigate the impact of climate change when building a sustainable urban built environment.",
    "Our applied research focuses on reducing carbon footprint, recovering used resources, and increasing productivity with integrated digital technologies. Areas of focus for the pillar include food security, energy efficiency, construction technologies, as well as the adoption of green and lower embodied carbon construction materials.",
    "3. Energy Resilience",
    "Ensuring a reliable and secure energy supply, and developing a dynamic energy sector for Singapore has always been a grand challenge. SIT has been working with public agencies and industry to develop integrated solutions to promote the usage of cleaner energy and increase energy efficiency.",
    "Areas of focus include energy efficiency, digital twinning, distributed generation, microgrid, green energy, and energy storage. Our applied research covers land transport as well as maritime shipping with the drive on electrification, energy storage and harnessing green energy.",
    "Manpower Training through Industrial Doctorates/Masters",
    "SIT offers Industrial Masters and Industrial Doctorate research-based programmes for mid-career professionals to deepen their specialist knowledge at the postgraduate level, without leaving their careers. The focus of these programmes taps on the university’s strengths in applied research and industry collaboration. The aim is to strengthen the industry-academia interaction and build Singapore’s pipeline for industry-relevant professionals with deep technical knowledge and specialisation skills, who are able to innovate and make improvements to current professional practice.",
    "Applied Research Centres (ARCs)",
    "To foster greater strategic partnerships that involve multidisciplinary applied research collaborations, talent development, as well as workforce training, SIT has set up various thematic Applied Research Centres (ARCs) to support industry in their respective needs:",
    "Construction Technology Innovation Laboratory (CTIL)",
    "A collaboration between SIT and Woh Hup Pte Ltd, the Construction Technology Innovation Laboratory (CTIL) provides a platform for Singapore-based construction companies and SIT researchers to carry out applied research and develop innovative technologies for building structures and sub-structures with societal and economic impact.",

    "SIT Project Team Members:",
    "A/Prof Steve Kardinal Jusuf, A/Prof Soh Chew Beng and A/Prof Ryan Tay Hong Soon",
    "Abstract:",
    "In recent years, Singapore has been pushing the adoption of solar PV as its main renewable energy source to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel. In addition, Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has set the target of producing 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs by 2030. With limited land size, meeting both targets are certainly very challenging. The solution is to integrate both systems by placing farming systems on the entire rooftop space and then cover them with PVs. The energy generated by the PVs can be used to power, either the farming system or the building. However, the impact of PVs coverage towards vegetable growth is not fully understood, as the PV will block much of the sunlight needed by the vegetables to grow. This project aims to develop optimum solution for both systems.",
    "The integrated system is then supported by the use of probiotics to increase crops’ yield and nutritional values. As the solar PV creates shading to the urban farming system, probiotics is used to promote growth and crops’ yield despite less sunlight available for vegetables to grow.",
