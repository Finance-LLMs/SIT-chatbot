    "Ultrasound utilises high-frequency waves to generate diagnostic-quality images. This module explores the critical analysis of ultrasound images, focusing on optimising image quality through the application of theoretical understanding in ultrasound physics and instrumentation.",
    "Learners will be familarised with the criteria for diagnostic quality images and acquire strategies to mitigate unwanted imaging artefacts. Additionally, they will develop the ability to identify equipment faults and conduct routine quality assurance checks.",
    "They will also have the opportunity for inter-professional learning during clinical experiences, facilitating the exchange of best practices. This will enhance their skills in recognising image artifacts, optimising image quality, and implementing quality assurance programs. It prepares the learners to become autonomous practitioners capable of safely and competently undertaking advanced practices.",
    "The module offers various learning activities including online lectures, demonstrations, workshops, assignments, and projects to provide a comprehensive learning experience.",
    "Who Should Attend",

    "Prerequisites",
    "Candidates must have relevant ultrasound related experience (preferably at least 1 year of working experience as an independent sonographer)",
    "Candidates must have the required access to a medical ultrasound facility to develop competency in the respective clinical applications. They must be actively engaged in supervised ultrasound clinical practice in the workplace for at least three days (or equivalent) per week. It is the candidate's responsibility to secure a supervised clinical arrangement in the workplace. At the end of the trimester, candidates must satisfy the clinical requirements (ie. compulsory logging the required number of ultrasound examinations in clinical portfolio and pass the clinical skills assessment)",

    "Dr. Ooi specialises in ultrasound modality since 2001. She graduated with a Diploma in Diagnostic Radiography from Nanyang Polytechnic in 1998, Bachelor of Applied Science (Medical Imaging) in 2000 from Charles Sturt University, Australia and Master in Medical Sonography in 2008 from Monash University, Australia. She has completed her PhD in Medical Imaging at Monash University. Her research area focuses on the application of advanced ultrasound imaging technique, namely ultrasound elastography, in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of musculotendinous problems. Her current research investigates the role of ultrasound elastography in early diagnosis of liver fibrosis and portal hypertension in patients suffering from chronic liver disease. She has received a number of competitive research grants, including the SingHealth Foundation and SGH Research Grant. Dr. Ooi is currently holding Joint Appointment at Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and was adjunct faculty at Nanyang Polytechnic. She is involved in teaching and training of junior radiographers, medical students and residents.  She is currently the PGAHI (Post Graduate Allied Health Institute) faculty trainer and workshop instructor. She presents regularly at local and international conferences and seminars.",

Thereafter, she joined Raffles Hospital to set-up the ultrasound department in their upcoming brand-new hospital then. Besides performing her clinical duties as a Senior Radiographer, she handled other non-clinical duties such as staffing rosters, quality assurance and the procurement process for ultrasound equipment.  In 2003, she pursued and obtained her Advanced Diploma in Sonography at NYP. She joined NYP in 2003 as a Radiography lecturer and completed her Masters in Medical Sonography under Monash University, Australia in 2006. She managed the Diploma programme in Diagnostic Radiography/Radiation Therapy and conducted lectures on Radiography modules. She was also a Course Coordinator of the Advanced Diploma in Sonography since 2007 and feels privileged to train the future aspiring sonographers. Currently, she is a Senior Sonographer at Perth Radiological Clinic and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth, Australia. She also assists in the teaching of SIT students in Radiography and Sonography related topics.",
