    "Reverse the Future: The Journey to an Award-Winning Video",
    "A group of SITizens share their experience of embracing risks and experimentation, ultimately leading to clinching the IPRS PRISM Award.",
    "From left: Gwen Koh Wen Hui, Augusta Lea Loi Pei Sze, Tan Shi Qin, Koh Juat Muay (President of Institute of Public Relations of Singapore (IPRS), Nur Atifah Hussain, April Leong Jia Yi (Photo: Institute of Public Relations of Singapore)",
    "In November 2023, five undergraduates from SIT's",
    "Digital Communications and Integrated Media (DCIM)",
    "degree programme received a Merit Award from the Institute of Public Relations of Singapore (IPRS). This recognition was part of the biennial IPRS PRISM Awards, which honours excellence in communication practice.",
    "The winning entry, 'Reverse the Future', not only secured recognition in the 'Outstanding PR Student Project' but is also a testament to the team’s dedication, creativity, and collaborative spirit. The talented team – consisting of April Leong (Director of Photography), Gwen Koh (Director), Tan Shi Qin (Editor), Augusta Lea Loi (Sound Designer), and Nur Atifah Hussain (Producer) – chose to deliver an immersive cinematic experience with elements of broodiness and nostalgia to invite the audience to immerse themselves in the narrative.",
    "The genesis of their award-winning project started with the brief to raise awareness among the young about sustainability in the",
    "Wide to Tall Film Festival (WTF2) — Sustainable Living: Human + Planet",
    ". This project was part of their Media Production for Marketing module coursework.",
    "The spark of inspiration for the video stemmed from Gwen's initial concept of delving into the past. She was inspired by the urgency of sustainability and online reverse challenge videos where people were doing things backwards. This concept resonated with the group, leading them to explore it further.",
    "Visually Compelling Narrative",
    "The team's resilience shone through as they overcame obstacles, reshaped their ideas, and pieced abstract elements into a visually compelling narrative.",
    "“Our lecturer, Ms Chrissie Choo, was not entirely positive during the pre-production stage. Our proposed abstract and black-and-white approach seemed bare and minimal, and the feedback was demoralising for the team at first, but we ended up working harder to refine our concept,” said Gwen.",
    "After further brainstorming through physical meetups and telegram group chats, they tweaked the concept and fixed the issues. “This led to better execution in the production and post-production stages, editing, colour grading, and screenings with the lecturer. The team took on the challenges with a more positive mindset, pushing through and achieving our end product,” said Gwen.",
    "In the video, paper houses serve as poignant symbols of 'homes' amidst the impact of climate change. (Photo: SITizens)",
    "April added, “Our initial idea was quite safe. Our lecturer pushed us to be more exploratory and try different things. The video ended up very different from our initial idea, where we wanted to stick with safer elements like prop-playing.”",
    "Eventually, the video features two visuals – paper houses that symbolise the “homes” amidst the harmful effects of climate change, and a human cast portraying friends working on a film together. Both visuals are woven together to create an enigmatic atmosphere that keeps the audience in suspense. The climax is when the frame transitions from close-ups to slowly zooming out to reveal a studio full of people -- the creatives behind the paper houses.",
    "Said Lea, “We believe that the project’s success was due to its authenticity and our use of abstract concepts. Elements such as breaking of the fourth wall which included scenes of the crew, and trending elements from social media, such as ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response sounds), was used to create a sense of nostalgia, and the use of fast-paced, diverse shots helped to capture viewers’ attention.”",
    "Dedicated to Excellence",
    "The team’s commitment extended beyond the filming process, as they crafted visuals from scratch and coloured the video themselves.",
    "While having video editing skills, the team was new to adapting a video to different formats and aspect ratios. The team needed to submit three versions: a one-minute Campaign Video that is 16:9, a 30-second Instagram reel that is 1:1, and a 15-second billboard video.",
    "“We had to learn to adapt videos to different formats and aspect ratios. For example, we had to create extra visuals for the billboard video, which required collaboration and additional graphics from other team members,” shared Shi Qin.",
    "The team experimented with various abstract concepts to captivate the audience's attention. (Photo: SITizens)",
    "The road to success was paved with dedication, collaboration, and unwavering passion. Clinching the IPRS Award was a complete surprise, validating their efforts and instilling a newfound confidence in their capabilities. It has also ignited the team’s passion for exploring diverse roles within the industry.",
    "“As undergraduates, we struggled with imposter syndrome, doubting whether our work would be recognised and unsure of its potential. We had to remind ourselves that our work could be recognised externally,” said Atifah.",
    "“The IPRS award is a pat on the back. It means that others see the potential of our ideas and capabilities. It has helped our portfolio and exposed us to what is expected in the industry.”",

This recognition was part of the biennial IPRS PRISM Awards, which honours excellence in communication practice.\nThe winning entry, 'Reverse the Future', not only secured recognition in the 'Outstanding PR Student Project' but is also a testament to the team’s dedication, creativity, and collaborative spirit. The talented team – consisting of April Leong (Director of Photography), Gwen Koh (Director), Tan Shi Qin (Editor), Augusta Lea Loi (Sound Designer), and Nur Atifah Hussain (Producer) – chose to deliver an immersive cinematic experience with elements of broodiness and nostalgia to invite the audience to immerse themselves in the narrative.\nThe genesis of their award-winning project started with the brief to raise awareness among the young about sustainability in the\nWide to Tall Film Festival (WTF2) — Sustainable Living: Human + Planet\n. This project was part of their Media Production for Marketing module coursework.\nThe spark of inspiration for the video stemmed from Gwen's initial concept of delving into the past. She was inspired by the urgency of sustainability and online reverse challenge videos where people were doing things backwards. This concept resonated with the group, leading them to explore it further.\nVisually Compelling Narrative\nThe team's resilience shone through as they overcame obstacles, reshaped their ideas, and pieced abstract elements into a visually compelling narrative.\n“Our lecturer, Ms Chrissie Choo, was not entirely positive during the pre-production stage. Our proposed abstract and black-and-white approach seemed bare and minimal, and the feedback was demoralising for the team at first, but we ended up working harder to refine our concept,” said Gwen.\nAfter further brainstorming through physical meetups and telegram group chats, they tweaked the concept and fixed the issues. “This led to better execution in the production and post-production stages, editing, colour grading, and screenings with the lecturer. The team took on the challenges with a more positive mindset, pushing through and achieving our end product,” said Gwen.\nIn the video, paper houses serve as poignant symbols of 'homes' amidst the impact of climate change. (Photo: SITizens)\nApril added, “Our initial idea was quite safe. Our lecturer pushed us to be more exploratory and try different things. The video ended up very different from our initial idea, where we wanted to stick with safer elements like prop-playing.”\nEventually, the video features two visuals – paper houses that symbolise the “homes” amidst the harmful effects of climate change, and a human cast portraying friends working on a film together. Both visuals are woven together to create an enigmatic atmosphere that keeps the audience in suspense. The climax is when the frame transitions from close-ups to slowly zooming out to reveal a studio full of people -- the creatives behind the paper houses.\nSaid Lea, “We believe that the project’s success was due to its authenticity and our use of abstract concepts. Elements such as breaking of the fourth wall which included scenes of the crew, and trending elements from social media, such as ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response sounds), was used to create a sense of nostalgia, and the use of fast-paced, diverse shots helped to capture viewers’ attention.”\nDedicated to Excellence\nThe team’s commitment extended beyond the filming process, as they crafted visuals from scratch and coloured the video themselves.\nWhile having video editing skills, the team was new to adapting a video to different formats and aspect ratios. The team needed to submit three versions: a one-minute Campaign Video that is 16:9, a 30-second Instagram reel that is 1:1, and a 15-second billboard video.\n“We had to learn to adapt videos to different formats and aspect ratios. For example, we had to create extra visuals for the billboard video, which required collaboration and additional graphics from other team members,” shared Shi Qin.\nThe team experimented with various abstract concepts to captivate the audience's attention. (Photo: SITizens)\nThe road to success was paved with dedication, collaboration, and unwavering passion. Clinching the IPRS Award was a complete surprise, validating their efforts and instilling a newfound confidence in their capabilities. It has also ignited the team’s passion for exploring diverse roles within the industry.\n“As undergraduates, we struggled with imposter syndrome, doubting whether our work would be recognised and unsure of its potential. We had to remind ourselves that our work could be recognised externally,” said Atifah.\n“The IPRS award is a pat on the back. It means that others see the potential of our ideas and capabilities. It has helped our portfolio and exposed us to what is expected in the industry.”\nWatch the award-winning video here.\nRemote video URL\nTopics\nSITizens\nCommunication and Design\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nBusiness, Communication and Design\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nFrom Student to Professor: A Remarkable Nursing Journey\nview\nNext\nShedding Light on Workplace Safety in Social Services\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences",
