The university converts these to grades using the mapping in the table as a guide, but this may be varied.\nMapping of percentage marks to grades and verbal descriptors of grades from the Code of Assessment\nGrade\nAggregate Score\n%\n(*BEng Programmes)\n%\n(**BSc Programme)\nGloss\nPrimary verbal descriptors for attainment of Intended Learning Outcomes\nA 1\n22\n84-100\n91-100\nExcellent\nExemplary range and depth of attainment of intended learning outcomes, secured by discriminating command of a comprehensive range of relevant materials and analyses, and by deployment of considered judgement relating to key issues, concepts and procedures\n2\n21\n80-83\n84-90\n3\n20\n77-79\n78-83\n4\n19\n74-76\n73-77\n5\n18\n70-73\n70-72\nB 1\n17\n67-69\n67-69\nVery Good\nConclusive attainment of virtually all intended learning outcomes, clearly grounded on a close familiarity with a wide range of supporting evidence, constructively utilised to reveal appreciable depth of understanding\n2\n16\n64-66\n63-66\n3\n15\n60-63\n60-62\nC 1\n14\n57-59\n57-59\nGood\nClear attainment of most of the intended learning outcomes, some more securely grasped than others, resting on a circumscribed range of evidence and displaying a variable depth of understanding\n2\n13\n54-56\n53-56\n3\n12\n50-53\n50-52\nD 1\n11\n47-49\n47-49\nSatisfactory\nAcceptable attainment of intended learning outcomes, displaying a qualified familiarity with a minimally sufficient range of relevant materials, and a grasp of the analytical issues and concepts which is generally reasonable, albeit insecure\n2\n10\n44-46\n43-46\n3\n9\n40-43\n40-42\nE 1\n8\n37-39\n37-39\nWeak\nAttainment deficient in respect of specific intended learning outcomes, with mixed evidence as to the depth of knowledge and weak deployment of arguments or deficient manipulations\n2\n7\n34-36\n33-36\n3\n6\n30-33\n30-32\nF 1\n5\n27-29\n27-29\nPoor\nAttainment of intended learning outcomes appreciably deficient in critical respects, lacking secure basis in relevant factual and analytical dimensions\n2\n4\n24-26\n23-26\n3\n3\n20-23\n20-22\nG 1\n2\n15-19\n15-19\nVery Poor\nAttainment of intended learning outcomes markedly deficient in respect of nearly all intended learning outcomes, with irrelevant use of materials and incomplete and flawed explanation\n2\n1\n10-14\n10-14\nH 0\n0\n0-9\n0-9\nNo convincing evidence of attainment of intended learning outcomes, such treatment of the subject as is in evidence being directionless and fragmentary\n*BEng refers to Bachelor of Engineering programmes **BSc refers to Bachelor of Science programmes\nIn order to be awarded the credits and to achieve the grades in the table, the student must have completed a course satisfactorily. If the student has not been awarded the credits for a variety of reasons, other gradings are used.\nFor example:\nMV means that the student had medical or personal circumstances, which prevented them from taking the exam at first sitting and students can take the re-sit without penalty.\nCW means that the student has not completed some part of the assessment, (exam, laboratory report etc) but can still do so before the next academic year. Contact the lecturer if in doubt as to what needs to be done.\nCR means that the student has not completed some compulsory element of the course (attended laboratories, etc) and it is not possible to remedy this in the current academic year. Students cannot change CR by taking a re-sit exam and would need to repeat the course. Contact the lecturer if in doubt as to why the student was refused credit for a course.\n07 means a deferred result – The university was not able to give the student a grade at the point in time. The reasons range from overseas study to plagiarism, so please ask if this is unexpected.\nZZ means that the student is a debtor. The student cannot see his results, until the debt has been cleared.\nEach grade also has an aggregation score on a scale from 0–22. These are used to calculate the student's average performance, which is needed to check the student's progress and for graduation. (There was formerly a 0–16 scale as well, but it is no longer in use.)\nPlease note that there is no re-sit available for Year 2 (Level 4) courses, such as Control 4N or Software Engineering 3N for BEng in Mechanical Design Engineering.\nchevron--up\nRules for Progression and Honours Assessment\nThe student's results at the end of each academic year must meet certain requirements for the student to progress through the degree programme. There are similar requirements for graduation. These are set out formally in the\nUniversity Calendar\n. The following is a brief, unofficial summary.\nProgression (BEng Programmes)\nFor progression from Year 1 (Level 3) to Year 2 (Level 4) in BEng, the student's Year 1 results, excluding the courses undertaken in Glasgow during OIP, must satisfy these conditions:\nSuccessful completion of 120 credits with a minimum grade of E3 in every course (130 credits for Aerospace programmes)\nA minimum grade of D3 in the best 110 credits\nGPA of at least 9.0 (i.e., D3) on the 0–22 scale\nThe student may re-sit courses in Year 1 to meet progression requirements. The grade points are capped at 9, corresponding to D3, and only the student's results from the first attempt in Year 1 will be carried forward to the student's degree classification.\nThe School Progress Committee meets in June and September to consider the progress of all students. They consider the student's results with any evidence of personal difficulties and decide whether the student:\nCan make normal progress to the next year of study\nWill be offered the opportunity to repeat some courses, in order to improve the student's results; there is no automatic right to any further reassessment beyond the first re-sit\nShould be excluded from further studies, in which case the committee will consider whether the student's results meet the standard for an exit award\nNote that Applicable Mathematics 2N, 2S, and 3S are included in the progression requirements but not in the degree classification. The courses undertaken in Glasgow during the OIP are included in the calculation of the Year 1 GPA, used for degree classification.\nProgression (BSc Programme)\nFor progression from Year 1 (Level 3) to Year 2 (Level 4) in the BSc, the student's Year 1 results must satisfy these conditions:\nSuccessful completion of 120 credits\nAn aggregate score of D3, (i.e. 9 on the University 22 point scale) in Year 1 (Level 3), at first attempt\nThe student may re-sit courses in Year 1 to meet the progression requirements or to meet pre-requisites for Year 2 (level 4) courses.\nThe purpose of progress requirements is to stop students from wasting time and money by studying for a degree programme that he or she is unlikely to complete.\nHonours Assessment\nHonours GPA\nHonours classification\n18.0 – 22.0\nFirst class\n17.1 – 17.9\nEither first or upper second class (at discretion of GSA Final Examination Board)\n15.0 – 17.0\nUpper second class\n14.1 – 14.9\nEither upper second or lower second class (at discretion of GSA Final Examination Board)\n12.0 – 14.0\nLower second class\n11.1 – 11.9\nEither lower second or third class (at discretion of GSA Final Examination Board)\n9.0 – 11.0\nThird class\n8.1 – 8.9\nEither third class or fail (at discretion of GSA Final Examination Board)\n0.0 – 8.0\nFail\nchevron--up\nGraduation Information for BEng Programmes\nThe university has general requirements for graduation and BEng has extra rules that are similar to those for progression. To successfully complete Year 2 (Level 4) in BEng, the student must satisfy these conditions at first assessment:\nSuccessful completion of 120 credits with a minimum grade of E3 in every course\nMinimum grade of D3 in the best 100 credits\nAverage GPA of at least 9.0 (i.e. D3) on the 0–22 scale\nGrade D3 or better in individual project work\nThese rules are set by the Engineering Council for accredited degrees. The student will be considered for the degree of BSc (Honours) in Engineering, which is not accredited, if the student meets the university’s standard requirements but not the extra rules. Note that the student requires a minimum grade of D3 in his major individual project for any honours degree, and that reassessment is not permitted in Year 2 (level 4).\nThe student's degree classification is calculated from a weighted average of results from Year 1 (Level 3) and Year 2 (Level 4), weighted 30/70.\nchevron--up\nGraduation Information for BSc Programme\nThe University has general requirements for graduation and the BSc has extra rules that are similar to those for progression. Year 2 (Level 4) has nine courses, and an individual project that counts for three courses. To successfully complete Year 2 (Level 4) in the BSc programme, the student must satisfy these conditions at first assessment:\nAn average grade of at least 9.0 (i.e. D3) on the 0-22 scale\nSuccessful completion of 120 credits\nA grade of at least D3 on the level 4 individual project\nThe student's degree classification is calculated from a weighted average of results from Year 1 (Level 3) and Year 2 (Level 4) weighted 40/60."
