    "Pedagogy that connects academic knowledge and skills with real world applications in industry",
    "Applied learning is central and core to SIT. We nurture our students to be active learners by providing them with authentic learning environments and real-world problems.",
    "Our goal is for them to leave SIT as deep specialists with the skill sets to contribute positively to Singapore’s economy and society.",
    "With an emphasis on applied learning, the Engineering degree programmes at SIT challenge students to use their academic knowledge to solve problems around them. This is done through collaborations with industry partners, where students get to reinforce their understanding of fundamental theories through practice.",
    "Students pick up knowledge and skills from industry projects, as well as through hands-on, experiential, and authentic learning such as industry labs and living lab. Students go on meaningful work placements, or Integrated Work Study Programme, where they take on a more in-depth scope of work related to the fields of their studies. The industry knowledge and experience they pick up from companies complement the theory they learn in classrooms. Students also work closely with the industry to form the basis of their capstone projects. By doing so, they are trained to work on real-world problems that exist within the industry.",
    "An SIT education offers students a deeply rewarding experience, both inside the classroom and within the industry. Through an applied curriculum, students embark on learning journeys to deepen their skill sets and emerge as work-ready graduates.",
