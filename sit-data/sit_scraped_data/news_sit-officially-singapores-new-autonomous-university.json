    "28 March 2014",
    "SIT is Officially Singapore’s New Autonomous University",
    "The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) has been officially awarded the status of an autonomous university by the Singapore Government with effect from 28 March 2014. SIT, whose main objective is to provide industry-focused education in Singapore, will thus have the same status and flexibility as that accorded to the existing four autonomous universities, namely, the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Management University, and Singapore University of Technology and Design.",
    "The SIT Act will grant SIT the right to confer and award degrees, diplomas and certificates. The SIT Act will also ensure that SIT is governed by an Act of Parliament to safeguard public interests and the use of public funds.",
    "As an autonomous university, SIT will begin to award degrees in its own name. For the first time, SIT is offering its own applied degree programmes in the areas of Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering, Information & Communications Technology, and Accountancy. These applied degree programmes were launched last year after close consultation with the industry and will feature industry-relevant curricula designed to meet industry needs. For instance, SIT has invited prominent industry leaders to be part of an Industry Advisory Committee (IAC) for each degree programme, to provide relevant input and advice to help shape the degree curricula. SIT has also launched the groundbreaking and innovative Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) as a core component of its new degrees. True to SIT’s industry-focused nature of applied learning, the IWSP will be tailored to complement work cycles in the different industries.",
    "SIT’s mission is to develop individuals who build on their interests and talents to impact society by providing a nurturing environment that is uniquely enriched by world-class partners. As Singapore’s new autonomous university, SIT envisions that it will grow to become the leader in innovative university education by integrating learning with industry and community perspectives and needs. SIT is expected to expand its intake to 2,000 students annually by 2015. The five",
    "SIT@Poly buildings",
    "will be fully operational by the end of this year. SIT is also in the process of locating a permanent campus to accommodate its growing number of students.",
    "Background",
    "Since 2009, when SIT was first established by the Ministry of Education, SIT has attracted much attention for its specialised degree offerings that cater primarily to polytechnic graduates. With a strong emphasis on practice-oriented education, SIT actively consults leading industry partners and government bodies to ensure the industry-relevance of its degree programmes that are offered in partnership with reputable overseas universities.",
    "The Government is increasing the number of publicly-funded full-time university places. By 2020, publicly-funded degree places will be available for 40 per cent of each Primary One cohort, up from 27 per cent in 2012. As Singapore’s fifth autonomous university, SIT will play a major role in this expansion plan.",
    "At the second reading of the SIT Bill in Parliament on 17 February 2014, Minister for Education Mr Heng Swee Keat said in support of the Bill that SIT is well-placed to pioneer the applied degree pathway. He said, “The applied degree pathway can better meet the broad range of learning preferences, strengths and interests that our young Singaporeans possess. By fostering a strong nexus with industry, it will enable our graduates to seize new and diverse job opportunities. This enriched university landscape will meet the individual learning needs of our youths, and in so doing, help them fulfil their potential to the fullest. By integrating a strong theoretical foundation with real life applications, and by combining hard skills and a range of soft skills such as communications, problem solving and teamwork, graduates from the applied degree pathway can distinguish themselves.”",
    "Professor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT, said, “This is an epochal moment for SIT and Singapore’s higher education landscape. SIT has steadily built a reputation for specialist, industry-focused education. The establishment of SIT as Singapore’s fifth autonomous university will enable us to better serve our students and ultimately contribute more to our economy and nation. I am very proud of my staff, who have worked hard to reach this historic and significant milestone. I am confident that our graduates, imbued with the unique SIT DNA of being ‘thinking tinkerers’, will play a pivotal part in Singapore’s continuing success in the years ahead.”",
    "About Singapore Institute of Technology",
    "Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is Singapore’s new autonomous university of applied learning. It aims to be a leader in innovative university education by integrating learning, industry and community.",
    "SIT offers industry-focused degree programmes targeted at growth sectors of the economy. As a new university, SIT offers its own applied degree programmes with a unique pedagogy that integrates work and study. It also offers specialised degree programmes in partnership with world-class universities and the five local polytechnics.",

SIT, whose main objective is to provide industry-focused education in Singapore, will thus have the same status and flexibility as that accorded to the existing four autonomous universities, namely, the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Management University, and Singapore University of Technology and Design.\nThe SIT Act will grant SIT the right to confer and award degrees, diplomas and certificates. The SIT Act will also ensure that SIT is governed by an Act of Parliament to safeguard public interests and the use of public funds.\nAs an autonomous university, SIT will begin to award degrees in its own name. For the first time, SIT is offering its own applied degree programmes in the areas of Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering, Information & Communications Technology, and Accountancy. These applied degree programmes were launched last year after close consultation with the industry and will feature industry-relevant curricula designed to meet industry needs. For instance, SIT has invited prominent industry leaders to be part of an Industry Advisory Committee (IAC) for each degree programme, to provide relevant input and advice to help shape the degree curricula. SIT has also launched the groundbreaking and innovative Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) as a core component of its new degrees. True to SIT’s industry-focused nature of applied learning, the IWSP will be tailored to complement work cycles in the different industries.\nSIT’s mission is to develop individuals who build on their interests and talents to impact society by providing a nurturing environment that is uniquely enriched by world-class partners. As Singapore’s new autonomous university, SIT envisions that it will grow to become the leader in innovative university education by integrating learning with industry and community perspectives and needs. SIT is expected to expand its intake to 2,000 students annually by 2015. The five\nSIT@Poly buildings\nwill be fully operational by the end of this year. SIT is also in the process of locating a permanent campus to accommodate its growing number of students.\nBackground\nSince 2009, when SIT was first established by the Ministry of Education, SIT has attracted much attention for its specialised degree offerings that cater primarily to polytechnic graduates. With a strong emphasis on practice-oriented education, SIT actively consults leading industry partners and government bodies to ensure the industry-relevance of its degree programmes that are offered in partnership with reputable overseas universities.\nThe Government is increasing the number of publicly-funded full-time university places. By 2020, publicly-funded degree places will be available for 40 per cent of each Primary One cohort, up from 27 per cent in 2012. As Singapore’s fifth autonomous university, SIT will play a major role in this expansion plan.\nAt the second reading of the SIT Bill in Parliament on 17 February 2014, Minister for Education Mr Heng Swee Keat said in support of the Bill that SIT is well-placed to pioneer the applied degree pathway. He said, “The applied degree pathway can better meet the broad range of learning preferences, strengths and interests that our young Singaporeans possess. By fostering a strong nexus with industry, it will enable our graduates to seize new and diverse job opportunities. This enriched university landscape will meet the individual learning needs of our youths, and in so doing, help them fulfil their potential to the fullest. By integrating a strong theoretical foundation with real life applications, and by combining hard skills and a range of soft skills such as communications, problem solving and teamwork, graduates from the applied degree pathway can distinguish themselves.”\nProfessor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT, said, “This is an epochal moment for SIT and Singapore’s higher education landscape. SIT has steadily built a reputation for specialist, industry-focused education. The establishment of SIT as Singapore’s fifth autonomous university will enable us to better serve our students and ultimately contribute more to our economy and nation. I am very proud of my staff, who have worked hard to reach this historic and significant milestone. I am confident that our graduates, imbued with the unique SIT DNA of being ‘thinking tinkerers’, will play a pivotal part in Singapore’s continuing success in the years ahead.”\nAbout Singapore Institute of Technology\nSingapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is Singapore’s new autonomous university of applied learning. It aims to be a leader in innovative university education by integrating learning, industry and community.\nSIT offers industry-focused degree programmes targeted at growth sectors of the economy. As a new university, SIT offers its own applied degree programmes with a unique pedagogy that integrates work and study. It also offers specialised degree programmes in partnership with world-class universities and the five local polytechnics.\nTopics\nApplied Learning\nCATEGORIES\nPress Releases\nEducation\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nSIT-GSA student design wins People’s Choice Award\nview\nNext\nSIT Partners the Cloud Security Alliance in Landmark Agreement\nview\nRelated News\n01 Apr 2025\nABS and the Singapore Institute of Technology Sign Strategic Agreement to Explore Innovation in Applied Research and Talent Development\nAdvancing Cutting-Edge Maritime Technologies and Nurturing Industry-Ready Talent\ntag\nPress Releases, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering\n06 Jan 2025\nSIT Introduces Singapore’s First Competency-Based Undergraduate Engineering Degrees and a Unique Interdisciplinary Business Programme\nSIT pioneers Competency-based Education (CBE) for Engineering undergraduates with two new degree programmes in Academic Year 2025.\ntag\nPress Releases, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design\n16 Oct 2024\nSIT Awards New Transcripts to Recognise Graduates’ Transferable Skills\nClass of 2024 graduates from two programmes are the first batch to receive the Record of Transferable Skills (RTS) transcripts.\ntag\nPress Releases, Education"
