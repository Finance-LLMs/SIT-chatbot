The signing ceremony was\nwitnessed by (\nstanding, from left):\nMr\nTan Kiat How, Minister of State, Ministry of Communications & Information and Ministry of National Development; and Mr Amit\nMidha\n, President, Asia Pacific & Japan, and Global Digital Cities, Dell Technologies\n.\nDell Technologies\ntoday announced a joint commitment with four Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to enhance the pre-employment training curriculum for over 5,000 tertiary students in Singapore over the next two years. The programme seeks to build and attract a robust talent pipeline for the local information and communications technology (ICT) sector by equipping undergraduate and graduate students with industry-relevant skills.\nTogether with the\nSingapore Institute of Technology (SIT)\n, Singapore Management University (SMU), Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) and Singapore Polytechnic (SP), Dell Technologies will co-develop new content for curriculum modules, specialist diplomas and degree courses focused on critical core skills tied to new and emerging technologies such as cloud computing, data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital cities management. These key skills were identified based on industry needs – through feedback from Dell Technologies and its partners and customers – and aligns with the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s (IMDA)\nServices 4.0 roadmap\n,\nwhich envisions the future of services using emerging technologies in a digital economy.\nThe programme\nwill be delivered by Dell Technologies Academy, and\ncomes under the Dell Technologies\nDigital Future - Made in Singapore\numbrella, which aims to fast track the adoption of future-ready digital solutions and drive innovations in Singapore for partners and customers globally.\nAccess to Curated Courses on Cloud and Dedicated Mentorship\nDell Technologies will work closely with the IHL professors and lecturers, offering customised tech expertise and consultation to aid in curriculum planning and curate cloud-native content to be included in students’ learning curriculum. Beyond curriculum design, students can benefit from Dell Technologies industry experts’ insights, and mentorship will also be offered to students as they navigate final year projects and industry attachments.\nStudents can look forward to immersing in the latest emerging technologies and industry-relevant content such as DevOps, microservices, cloud-native security, containers and Kubernetes. They will also get opportunities for hands-on experience via lab tutorial projects that highlight the importance and complexity of managing applications in an enterprise environment.\nWith the current hybrid education model, students from the four IHLs will be granted access to a suite of self-guided e-learning courses via Dell Technologies’ digital learning platform. These courses are designed to provide students with practical tech knowledge and skills that are in demand by the ICT sector, enhancing their employability and providing a head start to their future technology careers.\n“Dell Technologies is committed to work hand in hand with the Singapore government and tertiary education institutions to accelerate human progress through empowering students with training in deep tech skills,” said\nAmit Midha, President, Asia Pacific & Japan, and Global Digital Cities, Dell Technologies.\n“Under our\nDigital Future – Made in Singapore\ninitiative, Dell Technologies’ strategic partnerships with SP, NP, SMU and SIT will enhance the overall tech learning curriculum for students, uplift the ICT and cloud-native ecosystem in Singapore and advance the skills and employability of our future workforce.”\n“SIT is happy to co-develop content with Dell to jointly train future ICT talents. As Singapore’s University of Applied Learning, we provide avenues for students to work on real-world projects that deepen their knowledge and skills. This uniquely designed programme will allow students to acquire industry-relevant knowledge on emerging technologies, and gain rich insights through hands-on projects and close industry mentorship,” said\nProf Chua Kee Chaing, President-designate, SIT\n.\nRead the full press release\nhere\n.\nTopics\nIndustry\nApplied Learning\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nInfocomm Technology\nPress Releases\nAcademic Clusters\nIndustry & Community\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nCelebrating the Class of 2021: Meet 2 SITizens Who Embody the SIT-DNA\nview\nNext\nLifelong Learning is Key to Success\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
