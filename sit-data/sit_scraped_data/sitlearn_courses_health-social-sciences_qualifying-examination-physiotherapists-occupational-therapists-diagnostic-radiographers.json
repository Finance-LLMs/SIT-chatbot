Candidates are required to 1) identify the problems, 2) elaborate on the goals and rationale for chosen management on each clinical case, 3) identify any precautionary measures or contraindications during assessment, and 4) provide evidence-based justification for choice of management techniques and interventions used. Candidates are expected to provide correct analysis and assessment of case study, appropriate choice of treatment techniques on patient model and justification on treatment techniques.
