    "IoT Project: Smart Rubbish Bin",
    "This video showcase student projects from Year 1 Computer Programming Language module. Students are tasked to use what they have learnt from this module to build an Internet of Things (IoT) prototype with Data Analytics capability. This IoT Project is a smart rubbish bin that is contactless and would alert users when it is time to empty the bin.",

    "Aircraft Systems Engineering",
    "Flight Stability and Dynamics on Paper Plane 2",
    "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the principles of in-flight stability and estimate the maximum lift and drag forces of a paper plane. Students are required to test and launch three different paper plane designs and determine if the measurements of the paper plane, lift and drag forces as well as glide angles contribute to the stability of the plane.",
