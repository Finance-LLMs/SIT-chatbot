    "Process Safety Management (PSM) was pioneered by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1992 for the oil and gas sector. Its principles extend to other high-risk industries like chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and energy.",
    "Since 1992, many countries, including Singapore, have adopted US PSM regulations for compliance in their Major Hazard Installations to ensure safe operations and maintenance.",
    "This course equips learners with the knowledge required to establish, implement and organise a process safety management system. Learners will be introduced to the history of industrial accidents and the foundational concepts of an effective process safety management system. Additionally, it covers the procedures for effectively managing process hazards, emphasising the importance and requirements of the PSM elements as well as how they can be measured for ensuring safe and efficient plant operations.",
