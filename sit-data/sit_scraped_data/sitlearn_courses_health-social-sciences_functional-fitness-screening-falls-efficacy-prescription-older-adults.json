    "A longstanding quote of healthfulness:",
    "“Functional Fitness performance is having the physiological capacity to perform normal everyday activities safely and independently without undue fatigue” (Rikli & Jones, 1999)",
    "Active ageing is essential for older adults living well in the community. By staying mindful of their functional fitness, they can remain engaged and motivated to maintain regular physical activity. Beyond staying active, it's crucial for them to acquire skills to manage fall risks - common challenges that come with ageing. With resilience training and effective learning strategies, older adults can improve their quality of life and overall well-being.",
    "This course equips learners with the knowledge and skills to promote physical activity and therapeutic exercises in later life. It helps learners address the critical fitness components necessary for maintaining functional independence. Learners will learn to assess functional fitness and engage in empowering conversations that help older adults recognise the importance of maintaining their strength and balance.",
    "Learners will also gain insights into the concept of falls efficacy and develop the skills to foster greater self-efficacy in older adults, enabling them to confidently manage fall risks. Ultimately, this course aims to empower professionals to help older adults maintain independence, improve their well-being, and lead fulfilling lives.",
