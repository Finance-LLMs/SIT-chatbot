    "SIT plays an integral role in bridging academia and industry. This is possible because of our close ties with individuals, namely, students, alumni, and staff; as well as with industry partners with whom we co-create innovations and co-develop talent pipelines. These relationships make learning seamless for our students, whether they are working professionals or fresh out of school.",
