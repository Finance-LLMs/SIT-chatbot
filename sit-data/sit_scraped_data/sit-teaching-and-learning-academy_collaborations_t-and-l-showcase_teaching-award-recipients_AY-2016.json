    "As one who has students’ interest at heart, Associate Professor Alfred Tan employs a wide range of teaching strategies to engage diverse cohorts of undergraduates in both small and large classes in imparting his knowledge and skills to the students. His approach has significantly improved the overall student learning experience and led to quality learning outcomes. Through his facilitation, he has helped students develop critical thinking and communication skills. His advice encourages students they encounter challenges in their learning.",
    "Alfred regularly attends and participates in seminars and events related to teaching to constantly update and improve his teaching so as to ensure excellent student learning outcomes. He is strongly committed to creating an engaging, interactive and supportive classroom learning environment and encourages student participation in group discussions.",

    "How do you attract students' attention and interest in learning? Instead of directly introducing the new concepts, Assistant Professor An Hui often makes his teaching interactive and engaging by asking students with questions, training them on their critical thinking skills and gradually guiding them on the development and application of the theories. His teaching style is very down-to-earth, and with the aim of equipping students with up-to-date knowledge, thus ensuring that they are industry ready.",

Kwee Hiong’s approach involves motivating and getting students to work on real-life problems together in class and ensure interact as they work on the problems provided with guidance. His building-block approach by letting the students work on the basics first before tackling the more challenging aspects of the work has helped to instill confidence in the students’ ability and skill sets.",

At the start of his first lectures, students are informed of the motivation of learning the subject and he also listens and addresses to students’ feedbacks.\nMustafa actively involves students in industry projects in his modules and, thereby, providing the opportunity for students to assist in addressing industry challenges and providing feasible solutions which in turn provide them with the opportunity to be the ‘catalyst for transformation’. This leaning experience helps partly to prepare the students to be industry-ready upon graduation.\n(Abstract from citation by Eng evaluation committee member)\nDr Ng Lee Keng\nAssociate Professor Ng Lee Keng spent a great deal of time designing props, using e-learning tools, and inviting guest speakers to engage the students. Overall, from students’ consistent feedback, Lee Keng is excellent in teaching effectiveness, shows strong commitment to student learning, and is superb in innovation in terms of stimulating students’ learning interest.\n(Abstract from citation by DSB evaluation committee member)\nDr Victor Wang\nAssistant Professor Victor Wang actively employs technology to aid his teaching and put great emphasis on the application of knowledge in real-life engineering. With the diverse backgroundS of SIT students, Victor has been a key advocate of adaptive learning, designing math and physics bridging courses to prepare students for the rigor of undergraduate studies even before they enter SIT.  Evidently, his approach and efforts have significantly improved the overall student learning experience at SIT.\n(Abstract from citation by Eng evaluation committee member)"
