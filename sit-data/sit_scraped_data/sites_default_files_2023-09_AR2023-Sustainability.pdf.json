This is a recognition of the University’s efforts\nin implementing and championing sustainability in the\nworkplace by increasing eco-consciousness among staff\nin conserving resources and managing waste.\nSIT enhanced its infrastructure through ensuring water and\nelectricity efficiency, and responsible waste management.\nWe also reviewed existing procurement processes and\nencouraged staff to adopt GreenGov.SG’s latest measures\nwhen organising events and functions.DEVELOPING A SUSTAINABLE CAMPUS\nAT PUNGGOL CAMPUS\nBlock E4 Food Court Building achieved the BCA Green\nMark Platinum and Super Low Energy (SLE) certification.\nThe building features a hybrid cooling system and a\nBuilding Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) roof that generates\nrenewable energy. These would result in at least 40%\nenergy savings.\nThe smart building pools data from various building\nsystems. The first smart solution tracks the building’s\nelectrical energy usage to ensure energy consumption\ndoes not exceed the SLE threshold. It also includes a\ncalculator to help track and forecast the annual utility\nbudget. The second smart solution automates the\nbuilding’s ventilation and equipment operation based\non prevailing weather conditions.BUILDING A\nSUSTAINABLE CAMPUS\nThe Block E4 Food Court Building features a Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) roof that generates renewable energy.47\nSUSTAINABILITY AT SIT\nSUSTAINABILITY ACROSS SIT’S\nRESEARCH DOMAINS\nSustainability is featured across our 5 strategic translational\nresearch domains. These research domains are aligned with national and economic imperatives, and are bolstered\nby technology enablers such as AI. By working closely\nwith private and public sector partners, the outcomes\nfrom these domains will help to contribute to Singapore’s\ngoal of becoming a smart and sustainable nation.\nENSURING SINGAPORE’S FOOD\nSECURITY\nSIT has partnered local companies to develop novel future\nfoods derived from sustainable plant protein ingredients\nand single-cell proteins through fermentation. In our bid\nto lower our carbon footprint, we are also refining our\ntechnology platforms to enable greener plant protein\nextraction processes. GREEN SOLUTIONS WITH INDUSTRY &\nPUBLIC SECTOR\nThrough our Applied Research Centres, such as InnoHub,\nwe also work closely with industry and the public sector\nto develop innovative and viable sustainable solutions.\nSpearheaded by National Environment Agency (NEA),\na group of students, together with mentors from SIT’s\nInnoHub, worked on conceptualising and developing a\nrecycling receptacle — Bloobox — that was subsequently\nmass manufactured and distributed to all households\nin Singapore.DRIVING SUSTAINABILITY\nRESEARCH & INNOVATION\n(From left) SIT Professional Officers Kwong Kwok Kuen and\nRaymond Keh, with SITizens Ralph Faller and Axal Ang at the\nnationwide launch of Bloobox in March 2023 with Dr Amy\nKhor, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Sustainability and the\nEnvironment & Ministry of Transport, and Mr Wong Kang Jet,\nChief Executive Officer, National Environment Agency.\n(Photo: NEA/Hong Kah North CC/Ms Chan Wai Peng)\nA demonstration of the extrusion machine at the official\nopening of FoodPlant in April 2022, graced by Deputy Prime\nMinister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies\nHeng Swee Keat.\nSINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nANNUAL REPORT 202348\nSUSTAINABILITY AS A CORE VALUE\nOur core values support the University’s vision and\nmission. It is the foundation upon how we interact with\none another and engage with industry partners. Last year, we updated our core values to include\nSustainability, given how it permeates all our activities\n— from the education we provide and research we\nundertake — to how it shapes our policies and operations.\n• We are purposeful\nand united in\ndelivering on our\nmission\n• We are agile in\nresponding to\ndisruptions and\nopportunitiesPurpose and\nAgility\n• We respect one\nanother and are open\nto a diversity of views\n• We promote\nsustainability in\nour lifestyle and\noperations, education\nand research\nendeavoursRespect and\nSustainability\n• We maintain\na high level of\nprofessional\nintegrity at all\ntimes\n• We strive for\nexcellence in all\nthat we doIntegrity and\nExcellenceDEVELOPING\nSUSTAINABILITY TALENT\nSUSTAINABILITY EDUCATION FROM\nUNDERGRADUATES TO ADULT LEARNERS\nAll SIT undergraduates will have a baseline understanding\nof sustainability concepts through the ‘Introduction to\nSustainability’ micro-module. From AY2023, SIT will\nalso launch a Minor in Environmental Sustainability for\nundergraduate students of selected programmes, such\nas the Electrical Power Engineering degree programme.\nFor adult learners, they will be able to select from\nover 18 modules that cover sustainability-related\ntopics, from sustainable building engineering to green\ninterior design.49\nSUSTAINABILITY AT SIT\nSUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS\nIN FY2022\nWORLD\nENVIRONMENT\nDAY\nThemed ‘Only One Earth’, SIT organised a series of activities to drive home the\nmessage that we only have one planet to call home.\nAmong the activities organised were a virtual talk, upcycling workshops, a\nguided tour showcasing food composting at SIT@Dover, as well as a trip to the\nSustainable Singapore Gallery.\nThe ‘Getting Ready for the Green Economy’ panel discussion addressed\nsustainability-related challenges faced by industry, and business solutions\nimplemented by organisations. Over 150 staff, students and alumni also learned\nmore about growing job opportunities in sustainability.\nPanellists discussed\nthe impact of\nsustainability\non a company’s\nperformance.Mr Shiddalingeshwar Channabasappa Devihosur, Research\nEngineer (in blue shirt), explained to participants the concept\nbehind SIT’s simulated rooftop hydroponic farm that utilises\nsolar photovoltaics. Participants observed how food waste collected from SIT@Dover\nfood outlets is recycled into compost using a food composter.\nSEPTEMBER\n2022\nJUNE\n2022\nGETTING READY\nFOR THE GREEN\nECONOMY\nSINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nANNUAL REPORT 202350\nDeloitte conducted the\n‘Carbon Management and\nSustainability Reporting\nTraining’ for SIT staff.
