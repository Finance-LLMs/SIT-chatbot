We also want to develop students who are ‘Catalysts for Transformation’, to be able to make significant contributions to our society, and yet, at the same time, be ‘Grounded in the Community’, to reflect and give back to the community.\"",

Supported by Mapletree, the Challenge, which began in October 2018, culminated in the Grand Final, as six teams of students with entrepreneurial ideas for sustainable innovations presented their business ideas before a panel of distinguished judges.\nOver the past seven months, 520 SIT students have gone through a series of masterclasses on personal branding, interview and presentation skills, a forum discussion on entrepreneurship and sustainable innovation, as well as small group mentorship from industry experts on their entrepreneurial ideas. More information about\nThe Mapletree Challenge\nis detailed in Annex 1.\nAs part of the Grand Final, the teams vied for the Mapletree Gold award, up to $5,000 cash prizes, and the opportunity to get support for prototyping their idea.\nAmong some of the ideas that were presented are (a) innovations that seek to enhance the working efficiencies of healthcare workers, (b) a pedal-powered scooter, (c) an environmentally-friendly way for used tires to be recycled for road-paving, and (d) a cloud-based receipt invoicing system for SMEs. The judges were impressed by the teams’ creativity and presentations, and\nTeam Trolley\nemerged as The Challenge Champion, clinching the Mapletree Gold award and a cash prize of $5,000. The full list of prizes and winners is in Annex 2.\nThe top three teams of The Mapletree Challenge with Guest-of-Honour Dr Amy Khor (front row, centre), Senior Minister of State, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources & Ministry of Health, Prof Tan Thiam Soon (third from left), President, SIT and Mr Edmund Cheng (first from right), Chairman, Mapletree.\nProfessor Tan Thiam Soon, President, Singapore Institute of Technology said, \"As Singapore’s university of applied learning, we create an environment in which our students can apply the theories learnt in their classrooms to solve real-world problems and come up with ideas on practical applications.\nThe Mapletree Challenge\nis the first learning initiative of its kind at our young university, and it is a great example of a platform that integrates learning, industry and community. This is important because beyond academic pursuits, we place great emphasis in cultivating the SIT-DNA which will prepare our students to be ‘Thinking Tinkerers’ who are ‘Able to Learn, Unlearn and Relearn’. We also want to develop students who are ‘Catalysts for Transformation’, to be able to make significant contributions to our society, and yet, at the same time, be ‘Grounded in the Community’, to reflect and give back to the community.\"\nMr Edmund Cheng, Chairman of Mapletree, said \"As a real estate developer, investor, capital and property manager, Mapletree is always on the search for innovations to enhance sustainability. Aligned to our support for education, which is one of our four Corporate Social Responsibility pillars, it is our aim for\nThe Mapletree Challenge\nto provide entrepreneurial students with a platform to test their ideas and showcase innovative solutions which could be adapted into real life scenarios.\"\nWinning team of The Mapletree Challenge and their supporters with judges Dr Reto Callegari (first from left), Entrepreneur-in-Residence, SIT, Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (second from left), Advisor, Office of the President, SIT, Guest-of-Honour Dr Amy Khor (eighth from right), Senior Minister of State, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources & Ministry of Health, Prof Tan Thiam Soon (fifth from right), President, SIT, Mr Edmund Cheng (fourth from right), Chairman, Mapletree, Ms Heng Yeow Khing (third from right), Mapletree CSR Board Committee Member, Mr Wan Kwong Weng (second from right), Mapletree Group Chief Corporate Officer, and Ms Heng Sue Yuan (first from right), Vice-President, Corporate Communications, Mapletree.\nMr Edmund Cheng, Mapletree Chairman, presents a token of appreciation to Guest-of-Honour, Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources & Ministry of Health, while Prof Yaacob Ibrahim (first from left), Advisor, Office of the President, SIT, Mr Wan Kwong Weng (second from left), Mapletree Group Chief Corporate Officer, and Prof Tan Thiam Soon (second from right), SIT’s President look on.\nAnnex 1\nThe Mapletree Challenge\nin its entirety comprises the following components:\nJob Interview & Presentation Masterclasses\n(October 2018 to March 2019): Focused on helping students refine job interview skills and personal brand, with the workshops directed by leading corporate trainers.\nThe Mapletree Innovation and Entrepreneurship Forum\n(20 March 2019): Panel discussion focused on entrepreneurship and innovation.\nMentoring Masterclass\n(3 April and 10 April 2019): Coaching sessions on entrepreneurship and innovation, which honed students’ entrepreneurial ideas, persuasive pitching and presentation skills.\nThe Grand Final\n(2 May 2019): Selected participants applied their discipline-specific skills to generate ideas for sustainability and presented an innovative, practical and marketable plan to a panel of experts.\nThe Grand Final featured six competing student project teams who presented entrepreneurial ideas for sustainable innovations, in a 10 to 15-minute live presentation. Teams competed for The Mapletree Gold, Mapletree Silver, and Mapletree Bronze awards, cash prizes and the opportunity to have their ideas supported for prototyping.\nAnnex 2\nList of winners:\nPrize\nWinning team and members\nMapletree Gold\n($5,000 cash)\nTeam Trolley\nThe trolley innovation intends to enhance the design of a ‘changing’ trolley in a healthcare setting. The trolley aims to improve the workflow of staff when changing and cleaning patients and minimise time and money wastage from disruptions and laundry sorting errors. At the same time, the change in material and layout of the trolley also reduces the breeding of bacteria on the surfaces, ultimately improving the health of patients and promoting cost effectiveness for organisations.\nTeam members:\n- Abdul Rafi Bin Abdul Rahim\n, Bachelor of Science with Honours in Nursing\n- Ang Zi Qing\n, Bachelor of Science with Honours in Nursing\n- Chua Wen Ling Joanne\n, Bachelor of Science with Honours in Nursing\n- Tan Hong Da\n, Bachelor of Science with Honours in Nursing\nMapletree Silver\n(S$3,000 cash)\nFX1\nRevenue management is growing in complexity by being multi-dimensional, and there is a lack of modern tools available for training students in it. This results in ineffective traditional education that does not take advantage of the new technologies that are available. Our product aims to change that with an application by which students can learn the concepts of revenue management through simulations.\nTeam members:\n- Phee Wei Boon\n, Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computing Science\n- Samuel Seah\n, Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computing Science\nMapletree Bronze (S$2,000 cash)\nJNL\nOur system innovation aims to automatize and digitalise the existing business process of SMEs by utilising existing cloud computing technologies and data visualisation libraries to abolish the obsolete \"pen and paper\" practice that is still in use today. Studies have shown that employing cloud-based computing will generate numerous advantages, such as capital investment savings, simplification, scalability as well as real-time visibility of crucial information required. An Automated Seafood Receipt Processing System developed and deployed by the presenter for Jong Fresh Supplies Pte Ltd will be used as a prime example.\nTeam members:\n- Wong Yong Quan, Leslie\n, Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computing Science\n- Tong Jun Hong\n, Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computing Science\nConsolation Prizes (S$1,000 each)\nScooter Power\nWhile the use of electric scooters is considered a \"greener\" mode of transport for short distance travel, the majority still rely on electrical power generation. This team’s scooter can be efficiently powered through pedalling by an average-sized adult, and it has the potential for replacing less cost efficient electric scooters for short distance travel.\nTeam members:\n- Chan XinYin,\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Design Engineering\n- Liew Kar Quan,\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Design Engineering\n- Lim Jia Xin,\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Design Engineering\n- Wang Xin\n, Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Design Engineering\nConsolation Prizes (S$1,000 each)\nYARJ Green Insight\nIn line with Singapore’s vision of being a zero waste nation, YARJ Green Asphalt is proposing the incorporation of waste rubber tires (crumb rubber) into bituminous pavements. YARJ Green Asphalt is an environmentally friendly method to pave Singapore’s roads and ensure a constant 100% recycling rate of waste rubber tires. YARJ Green Asphalt, when implemented appropriately, will have the potential to improve the quality of Singapore’s current pavements and also help rectify a growing environmental problem.\nTeam members:\n- Aliff Hamzah Bin Abdul Aziz\n, Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Civil Engineering\n- Tor Lok Wei Joel\n, Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Civil Engineering\n- Rennie Toh Qian Yu\n, Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Civil Engineering\n- Tan Yong Quan\n, Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Civil Engineering\nConsolation Prizes (S$1,000 each)\nNg Wei Da, Jim\nRelationship problems and family conflicts are routine in our daily lives.
