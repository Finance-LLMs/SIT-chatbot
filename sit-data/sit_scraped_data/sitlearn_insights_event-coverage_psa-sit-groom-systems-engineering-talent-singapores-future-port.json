This will stand them in good stead when they apply what they have learnt to their work, while at the same time ensuring that they are future-ready for our next-generation port.\"",
    "Professor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT, said, \"As a University of Applied Learning, SIT is committed to working closely with companies like PSA to enhance our nation’s competitiveness and to ensure that the competencies of our local workforce is continuously strengthened and remains relevant. This is important in the current climate of rapid technological change where productivity skills and innovation will be the key drivers of growth for our future. Continuous learning isn’t about just training. It is also about the aspirations of our professionals who want to hone their skills and raise their standards to do better for themselves, their families and their employers. SIT is proud to have contributed to the development of these graduates. The programme has been a success and we look forward to be part of PSA’s continuous drive to deep skill their employees.\"",
