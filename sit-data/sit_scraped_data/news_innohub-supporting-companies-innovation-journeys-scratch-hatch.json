    "InnoHub: Supporting Companies’ Innovation Journeys from Scratch to Hatch",
    "A one-stop centre for innovation at the Singapore Institute of Technology is offering services to drive innovation in the industry, from ideation to co-development of new or improved solutions as well as test-bedding.",
    "InnoHub, helmed by SIT’s A/Prof Ivan Lee (back row, sixth from left), comprises four innovation centres. (SIT Photo: Keng Photography/Tan Eng Keng)",
    "Innovation can be achieved with major breakthroughs or more often through improvements that can lead to the introduction of new products, processes, designs, business models or services – and a university in Singapore is taking comprehensive steps to play an integral role in catalysing innovation in the industry.",
    "The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) set up the Innovation Hub, also known as",
    "InnoHub",
    ", early this year to provide an integrated end-to-end innovation infrastructure that helps businesses drive innovation, from ideation to product development and sample production for market testing, prior to scaling up.",
    "“The idea is to provide integrated solutions to multidisciplinary problems and journey with the industry in their innovation pursuits,” says",
    "Associate Professor Ivan Lee",
    ", SIT’s Vice President for Innovation, who helms InnoHub as its head.",
    "Encompassing four innovation-focused centres, the InnoHub aims to be a one-stop centre for industry innovation. The innovation centres include the Design Factory@SIT (DF@SIT), the Rapid Product Innovation and Development (RaPID) Centre, the SIT-Poly Innovation Centre of Excellence (SPICE), and the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (NAMIC) Hub@SIT.",
    "InnoHub – An integrated innovation infrastructure to support industry innovation.",
    "Driving Innovation in an Open Ecosystem",
    "As a one-stop centre, InnoHub drives innovation by ideating and co-developing innovative and commercially viable solutions with industry, pooling together domain experts who possess deep industry know-how as well as facilities and capabilities across different disciplines to provide an integrated innovation infrastructure.",
    "This is exemplified by the",
    "Design Factory@SIT (DF@SIT)",
    "which supports businesses in improving their values through human-centric designs that solve real-world problems. Through design innovation and experimentation, DF@SIT co-creates unique value propositions with companies to improve their business models, products, processes, designs and/or services.",
    "Meanwhile, the",
    "Rapid Product Innovation and Development (RaPID) Centre",
    "offers speedy and flexible prototyping and sample product development capabilities. For example, it recently collaborated with a local company to develop a solution to deter birds from picking food scraps off dustbins. The RaPID centre provided core capabilities in engineering design, systems integration and iterative development to enhance the realisation of the idea. Further refinements to the prototype were made until it was proven workable for scaling up.",
    "Likewise, the",
    "National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (NAMIC) Hub@SIT",
    "will co-develops advanced additive manufacturing (such as 3D printing) technologies for industry test-bedding and adoption. NAMIC offers a range of services including AI-driven generative designs, structural topology optimisation and pilot production to enable the industry to innovate with speed and efficiency.",
    "The",
    "SIT-Poly Innovation Centre of Excellence (SPICE)",
    "provides small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with access to expertise, facilities and equipment, and a diverse talent pool within SIT and across the various Centres of Innovation at the Polytechnics to help them develop new products and services. Tapping on SIT’s and the Polytechnics’ existing resources reduces the risks associated with early-stage investments, and allows them to focus on creating the right products for the right problems.",
    "Companies can engage the innovation centres as required. A recent example saw both DF@SIT and RaPID Centre collaborating with a logistics company to design and develop an improved climate-controlled storage unit. Such storage solutions have been invaluable for storing medications and food supplies amid the global supply chain disruption challenges.",
    "Driving innovation in an open ecosystem, InnoHub also extends its network of innovation partners to include SIT’s Applied Research Centres and other external collaborators. Leveraging this, InnoHub coordinates the required resources and capabilities to undertake more extensive and multi-disciplinary projects with industry, traversing across the ecosystem’s value chain.",
    "Developing Catalysts for Transformation",
    "Beyond gaining access to academic staff and students, companies will be able to access a pool of upcoming graduates who have gained practical experience and innovation skills by working on industry projects.",
    "These graduates form a talent pipeline of innovators and value creators for the companies. By working together with the hub and its ecosystem of partners on innovation projects, the companies’ employees will also deepen their technical skills and acquire innovation skillsets to catalyse and support business transformations.",
    "Nurturing a talent pipeline of innovators and value creators for the industry.",
    "InnoHub is rolling out structured innovation programmes to train employees of interested companies on practical innovation skills by working on company-specific projects. The trainees will learn the relevant product development methodology and innovation skills that will help to catalyse innovation in their companies.",
    "“Through InnoHub, SIT will work with industry to co-develop and adopt innovative solutions facilitated by our industry-friendly intellectual property (IP) policies. We will also train the companies’ employees in technical and innovation skills to support their business transformation plans”, says A/Prof Lee.",

(SIT Photo: Keng Photography/Tan Eng Keng)\nInnovation can be achieved with major breakthroughs or more often through improvements that can lead to the introduction of new products, processes, designs, business models or services – and a university in Singapore is taking comprehensive steps to play an integral role in catalysing innovation in the industry.\nThe Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) set up the Innovation Hub, also known as\nInnoHub\n, early this year to provide an integrated end-to-end innovation infrastructure that helps businesses drive innovation, from ideation to product development and sample production for market testing, prior to scaling up.\n“The idea is to provide integrated solutions to multidisciplinary problems and journey with the industry in their innovation pursuits,” says\nAssociate Professor Ivan Lee\n, SIT’s Vice President for Innovation, who helms InnoHub as its head.\nEncompassing four innovation-focused centres, the InnoHub aims to be a one-stop centre for industry innovation. The innovation centres include the Design Factory@SIT (DF@SIT), the Rapid Product Innovation and Development (RaPID) Centre, the SIT-Poly Innovation Centre of Excellence (SPICE), and the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (NAMIC) Hub@SIT.\nInnoHub – An integrated innovation infrastructure to support industry innovation.\nDriving Innovation in an Open Ecosystem\nAs a one-stop centre, InnoHub drives innovation by ideating and co-developing innovative and commercially viable solutions with industry, pooling together domain experts who possess deep industry know-how as well as facilities and capabilities across different disciplines to provide an integrated innovation infrastructure.\nThis is exemplified by the\nDesign Factory@SIT (DF@SIT)\nwhich supports businesses in improving their values through human-centric designs that solve real-world problems. Through design innovation and experimentation, DF@SIT co-creates unique value propositions with companies to improve their business models, products, processes, designs and/or services.\nMeanwhile, the\nRapid Product Innovation and Development (RaPID) Centre\noffers speedy and flexible prototyping and sample product development capabilities. For example, it recently collaborated with a local company to develop a solution to deter birds from picking food scraps off dustbins. The RaPID centre provided core capabilities in engineering design, systems integration and iterative development to enhance the realisation of the idea. Further refinements to the prototype were made until it was proven workable for scaling up.\nLikewise, the\nNational Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (NAMIC) Hub@SIT\nwill co-develops advanced additive manufacturing (such as 3D printing) technologies for industry test-bedding and adoption. NAMIC offers a range of services including AI-driven generative designs, structural topology optimisation and pilot production to enable the industry to innovate with speed and efficiency.\nThe\nSIT-Poly Innovation Centre of Excellence (SPICE)\nprovides small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with access to expertise, facilities and equipment, and a diverse talent pool within SIT and across the various Centres of Innovation at the Polytechnics to help them develop new products and services. Tapping on SIT’s and the Polytechnics’ existing resources reduces the risks associated with early-stage investments, and allows them to focus on creating the right products for the right problems.\nCompanies can engage the innovation centres as required. A recent example saw both DF@SIT and RaPID Centre collaborating with a logistics company to design and develop an improved climate-controlled storage unit. Such storage solutions have been invaluable for storing medications and food supplies amid the global supply chain disruption challenges.\nDriving innovation in an open ecosystem, InnoHub also extends its network of innovation partners to include SIT’s Applied Research Centres and other external collaborators. Leveraging this, InnoHub coordinates the required resources and capabilities to undertake more extensive and multi-disciplinary projects with industry, traversing across the ecosystem’s value chain.\nDeveloping Catalysts for Transformation\nBeyond gaining access to academic staff and students, companies will be able to access a pool of upcoming graduates who have gained practical experience and innovation skills by working on industry projects.\nThese graduates form a talent pipeline of innovators and value creators for the companies. By working together with the hub and its ecosystem of partners on innovation projects, the companies’ employees will also deepen their technical skills and acquire innovation skillsets to catalyse and support business transformations.\nNurturing a talent pipeline of innovators and value creators for the industry.\nInnoHub is rolling out structured innovation programmes to train employees of interested companies on practical innovation skills by working on company-specific projects. The trainees will learn the relevant product development methodology and innovation skills that will help to catalyse innovation in their companies.\n“Through InnoHub, SIT will work with industry to co-develop and adopt innovative solutions facilitated by our industry-friendly intellectual property (IP) policies. We will also train the companies’ employees in technical and innovation skills to support their business transformation plans”, says A/Prof Lee.\nCompanies can reach out to the team at\ninnohub@singaporetech.edu.sg\nto innovate or attend structured innovation programmes.\nThis article first appeared in\nGovInsider\n.\nTopics\nFeatures\nIndustry\nApplied Research\nInnoHub\nInnovation\nSIT Expert Spotlight\nCATEGORIES\nAcademic Clusters\nEngineering\nApplied Research & Innovation\nIndustry & Community\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nCompetency-Based Education: A Practical Approach to In-Employment Learning\nview\nNext\nFrom Lab to Rail: SMRT and SIT to Set Up Transport Living Lab to Solve Operational Issues\nview\nRelated News\n26 Mar 2025\nPower Through Emotion\nSIT, Chemistry and Pod of Life unveil a new approach to combat workplace burnout through The Emotional Baggage Board Game.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Academic Clusters, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n18 Sep 2024\nOCBC to Invest $500 Million in Punggol Digital District\nInvestment includes a multi-million-dollar strategic partnership with SIT\ntag\nPress Releases, Industry & Community, Academic Clusters, Business, Communication and Design, Infocomm Technology\n23 Jun 2023\nHelping Mental Health Patients Lead Meaningful Lives\nCognitive remediation expert A/Prof Tan Bhing Leet was recently awarded the 2023 Connie Lieber Science to Practice Award for Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry.\ntag\nAcademic Clusters, Health and Social Sciences"
