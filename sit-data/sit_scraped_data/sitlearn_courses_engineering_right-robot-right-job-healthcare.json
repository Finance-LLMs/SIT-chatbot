    "About Course",
    "The first robot in the medical field emerged in the 1980s, providing surgical assistance through robotic manipulation technology. Since then, both hardware and software robotic technologies have advanced significantly, being utilised not only within operating rooms but also in clinical settings.",
    "This advancement aids healthcare workers by simplifying tasks and enhancing patient care through smoother workflows. Robotic technologies are also employed within research laboratories to automate manual, repetitive, and high-volume tasks, thereby liberating the human workforce to concentrate on more strategic responsibilities and expediting discoveries.",
    "This course aims to equip you with fundamental knowledge of robotics, encompassing both hardware and software aspects. This includes the evolution and future trends of robotics, understanding robot anatomy and performance characteristics, as well as basic concepts in robotic process automation. These foundational principles will play a crucial role in selecting the appropriate robots for specific tasks within healthcare settings.",
    "Additionally, you will be introduced to basic problem-solving methodologies, including identifying inefficiencies, conducting root cause analysis, and creating project charters. These methodologies are fundamental to initiating the implementation of robotic solutions. Throughout the course, hands-on activities will be integrated to provide you with experiential learning opportunities, enhancing your understanding and appreciation of the content covered.",
