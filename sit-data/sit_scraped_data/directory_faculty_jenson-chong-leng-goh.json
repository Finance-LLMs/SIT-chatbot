    "The goal of this project is to provide transformative ways for decision-makers: a systemic view where they could experience the benefits of suboptimality to feed robustness in a fluctuating world. We propose to co-create two game platforms where participants could test suboptimal solutions to address their issues: (i) an online platform where users can enter parameters in set conditions (with stochastic variations), with the goal to survive for the longest time (with options ranging from over-optimized to suboptimal inputs), (ii) an in-person training program (small group) where participants share their (real) current issues and attempt to find the most robust way forward, with the help of disruptive/fluctuating elements and pinpointing the added values of their weaker points (once integrated in a systemic view). In both cases, the process forces the users to adapt and transform their projects or initial question until they tick 3 milestones (human health & social health & water-soil-biomass health), followed by a stress test to make sure it is robust. The p​​​​​roject was awarded by the Balaton Group: http://www.balatongroup.org and the project amount is USD20,00/=.",
