    "Grit and perseverance pay off for “Lobang King” Felix",
    "SIT Scholar Felix Tan grinds through life’s challenges, overcoming adversity with a “never-say-die” attitude.",
    "15 January 2025",
    "“Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine being where I am today,”",
    "shares final-year Accountancy student Felix Tan as he reflects on his SITizen journey.",
    "The only one in his family to pursue a university education, the former Normal (Academic) student might not have ventured this far if not for his resilience and perseverance.",
    "After completing his secondary education, he went on to complete a Higher Nitec in Accounting at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Thereafter, he was accepted into Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) and he graduated with a Diploma in Banking and Financial Services. In 2022, Felix enrolled at SIT after a successful application appeal.",
    "“I was given a second chance, one I am thankful for every day,” Felix shares appreciatively. He is also deeply grateful for the KKH Scholarship, awarded to financially needy students who demonstrate exemplary leadership qualities and outstanding academic achievements. The annual scholarship is made possible through a gift to SIT from Mr Kuok Khoon Hong, Chairman and CEO of Wilmar International.",
    "\"The scholarship has had a profound impact on my journey. It's not just the financial support but also a recognition of the grit and perseverance that brought me here. With fewer financial constraints, I've been able to focus on my studies and contribute to my community,\" says Felix.",
    "Entrepreneurial beginnings",
    "At just 13, Felix took on part-time work while studying to help support his family after his father’s business folded. For about six years, the family of four lived in a single room at a relative’s house. The past 14 years have taught him to be streetwise and resourceful. At 15, he discovered he could fetch a higher price for his used laptop over Carousell, sparking a business idea to help others sell their wares online for a fee. This entrepreneurial journey eventually led him to establish a start-up offering consultancy services when he was 18.",
    "“This retail shop, where I did part-time work, needed many part-timers for an annual fair and I thought that was a good opportunity. I have many friends, so I told the manager to let me bring in the part-timers. And that’s how my mini business of seven years started,” says Felix, known among friends as the “Lobang King” - a Singlish term for someone with valuable opportunities or connections. Over the years, he accumulated experience across industries, including sales, event management, retail, food and beverage, marketing, human resources, advertising, and market research.",
    "Despite his early ventures, Felix was determined to pursue a university education. He explains,",
    "\"I want to be both book-smart and street-smart. If you're a salesman without a strong foundation, you're just selling fluff. Conversely, if I know everything but do not have the soft skills, I can't truly deliver what I want across.\"",
    "Felix (fifth from left) as a Cadet Inspector with his NPCC mates back in his secondary school days.",
    "Dedication to Excellence",
    "Felix’s work ethic and dedication to excellence earned him the Best Commander Award and an Honour Graduate during National Service. These traits were evident at a young age, where juggling work and studies, Felix held many leadership roles. As a Cadet Inspector with the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), he spearheaded training and development as an Area Chairman for no less than eight secondary schools, organised National Day Observance Ceremony for Woodgrove GRC, and Adventure and Survival Training Camps as a Camp Coordinator. He also served as a student councillor, executive committee member of the Investment Club and Entrepreneurship Club, as well as an orientation camp facilitator.",
    "At SIT, he has served as President of the Accountancy Student Management Committee, leading the committee in organising 30 events that contributed to SIT receiving its first Distinguished Partner Award from the Institute of Chartered Accountants England and Wales. He is also a Bloomberg Student Mentor, SITizen Ambassador and Youth Ambassador for CFA Society Singapore and Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants.",
    "Felix conducting a sharing session at his alma mater ITE as an ISCA (The Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants) Youth Ambassador.",
    "Always eager to learn, Felix embraced challenges head-on. Unfazed by a bank internship in a middle office technology role, an area completely foreign to him, he challenged himself to learn from scratch and make the best out of it, eventually emerging among the top in his polytechnic cohort.",
    "Felix's determination to uplift his family's standard of living has been his driving force. Thankfully, the hard work started to pay off when his family achieved a three-room HDB flat to call their own six years ago.",
    "Currently, Felix works part-time at an asset management firm while serving an eight-month internship as a Deal Advisory Intern at KPMG Singapore under the Integrated Work Study Programme. Aspiring to be a chartered accountant and obtain a Chartered Financial Analyst certification, he hopes to secure a full-time role that allows him to continue his part-time work, in hopes of further upgrading his family’s standard of living.",
    "Passionate about fostering cross-cultural connections and sharing his knowledge with others, Felix also gives motivational talks at his ITE alma mater, where he shares his journey, the challenges he faced, and lessons he learnt. Like himself, Felix hopes to inspire his juniors to follow their dreams and embrace diversity, empowering them to make a meaningful impact on the world.",
    "No regrets",
    "Despite the longer journey, Felix remains grateful for the experiences, the support of generous donors like Mr Kuok, and the invaluable guidance from mentors like Associate Professor Pearpilai Jutasompakorn and Mr Sunny Soh from SIT, his former tertiary lecturers, Mr Zen Low and Ms Lee Foong Mui, and his current boss, Mr Justin Lam.",
    "“I don't have any regrets. Some people take more time to mature and enjoy studying. My experiences allowed me to reflect and strategise my next steps,” he says. Quoting Nelson Mandela, Felix adds,",
    "\"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\"",
    "Felix (rightmost, holding the banner) with fellow volunteers at Xin Yuan Community Care. Co-organised by SIT's Accountancy and Hospitality Business Student Management Committees, the Parents' Day event brought together over 80 student volunteers and reached more than 170 seniors in Toa Payoh.",
