    "In today's fast-paced and dynamic business environment, change is constant. Most organisations aim to produce valuable and usable software in shorter cycles, involving customers and stakeholders throughout the development process. Through continuous improvement via an iterative development approach, this reduces the risk of project failure while ensuring faster time to market. This also ensures that the end product addresses real user needs, leading to higher customer satisfaction and better outcomes.",
    "In this course, you will learn to apply the values and principles of Agile, as well as philosophies and practices of DevOps and software development frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban. You will gain competencies in incorporating UX practices and research in an agile software development environment to aid in the design and development of usable digital solutions.",
    "In the area of designing and developing a full stack secured software solution, you will examine modern concepts in web technologies that form the fundamental building blocks of front-end and back-end applications. You will design software/application structures and document concepts, translating requirements into software design structures for implementation. Thereafter, learn to build an end-to-end secure web application that provides a seamless online experience to users.",
    "Lastly, you will distil and demonstrate the attained competencies in an actual project, working in teams to design and develop a usable digital solution over sprints.",
    "Integrating online and in-person delivery, the micro-credential offers various learning activities such as laboratory sessions, online consultations, and a proctored exam. Upon completion, learners may directly sit for the Professional Scrum Master (PSM1) certification.",
