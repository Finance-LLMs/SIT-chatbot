    ".",
    "This module focuses on the concepts of structural stability and dynamic problems in civil engineering.",
    "The module will also touch on developing fundamental equations and explain the structural response with respect to both dynamic loads and static stability. Application-based activities will be conducted during the study, including modelling and calculating the buckling and natural frequency behaviour of complex structural systems. Emphasis is placed on both analytical methods and numerical solution techniques to demonstrate the importance of model validation.",
    "Computation tools will be developed and integrated into individual project assignments for the assessment of complex structures (which are subjected to dynamic excitation and stability constraints). A final written paper will assess the fundamental knowledge acquired during the module.",
