Ukraine also\nsupplies 15 per cent of the world’s\nmaize and Russia 13 per cent of the\nworld’s corn exports.\nExtended periods of drought\nhave also resulted in crop failures\nin India, a major source of wheat.\nCountries have raced to secure\nfood for their own people amid\nconcern over declining supplies.\nThese constrain the flow of food\ncommodities across borders and\ndrive prices up.\nAs a result, countries are\nresorting to protectionist trade\npolicies, raising export quotas and\ntaxes, and banning the export of\nsome items.\nBy May, Dr Capri counts 35\ncountries as having resorted to\nsome form of food protectionism,\nfrom Argentina blocking exports\nof soya bean meal and oil, to Egypt and India banning exports of\nwheat.\nChemical fertilisers have also\nfallen under the shadow of food\nprotectionism.\nMalaysia’s chicken farmers have\ncome under pressure because of\nthe rising cost of chicken feed.\nAt the same time, climate change\nis creating various challenges for\nthe world’s food supply.\nThe Hinrich Foundation report\nnotes that extended drought,\nheatwaves and wildfires, flooding,\npestilence, soil erosion and water\nscarcity are conspiring against\nfuture crop productivity and\ncontinuity.\nAnd leveraging scientific\ninnovation and technology can\nhelp a country improve its food\nsecurity. Technology spans areas\nsuch as seed resilience, precision\nagriculture technologies, vertical\nfarming, lab-grown protein as well\nas water scarcity and agri-tech.\n“Scientists are engineering\nhardier, more resilient seeds for\nfoods such as wheat, rice, corn and\nsoya beans. As such, the world’s\nleading seed companies rely on\nmore research and development\n(R&D) to keep up with the\nchallenges of food security,” the\nreport notes.It also cited how in 2019, the\nworld’s largest agrochemical\ncompanies had a market\ncapitalisation of US$233 billion\n(S$324 billion).\nLast year, the agricultural\nbranch of German manufacturer\nBayer invested US$2.1 billion in\nR&D for crop science, which\nproduced 430 different varieties\nof hybrid seeds for vegetables,\ncotton, corn and soya beans.\nThe report adds: “Increasingly,\nthe world’s leading agricultural\ncompanies look more like\ntechnology firms.\n“Today, leading-edge R&D for\nfood security is based on\nmolecular genetics, plant\nbiology/physiology, recombinant\nDNA, advanced genetic\nengineering, and bio-informatics,\nwhich analyses complex biological\ndata such as genetic codes.\n“Recent research has been\nremarkable, leading to, among\nothers, less water-dependent\ncrops and more profuse\nphotosynthesis in leafy\nvegetables.”\nFOOD INNOVATION\nThere is a fair bit of innovation and\ninvestment already taking place.\nThese widen the availability of\nchoices for consumers as\nconventional meat consumption\ngrows and prices rise.\nThe Singapore Institute of\nTechnology (SIT) is working with\nindustry partners on healthier\nplant-based products, and in April,\njointly launched with Enterprise\nSingapore and JTC Corporation a\nshared facility for companies to\ntest products in smaller batches\nfor small-batch food production.\nThe facility in Senoko Drive is a\nkey part of the university’s\nsustainable food innovation\nprogramme, which aims to help\nlocal companies grow and\ninnovate through food technology.\nThat same month, SIT also signed a collaboration agreement\nwith The FoodBowl, a New\nZealand government-supported\nfood innovation network, to\ndevelop sustainable food\ninnovations that benefit people\nand the planet.\nIn March, California food tech\ncompany Eat Just broke ground on\nthe largest plant-protein factory\nhere yet on a 2.7ha plot – a little\nsmaller than four football fields –\nin Pioneer.\nAnd earlier this month, it broke\nground on a new 30,000 sq ft\nfacility in Bedok, which will be\nAsia’s largest cell-cultured chicken\nplant.\nLast week, The Sunday Times\nreported that Malaysia’s ban on\nchicken exports saw an uptick in\nsales for alternative meats.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has also\nmade people more conscious of\nclimate change and issues like\nanimal welfare, food safety and\nfood security.\nFor now, many hope that fresh\nchicken from across the Causeway\ncan resume being shipped to\nSingapore as it was before June 1,\nand sooner rather than later.\nIf it doesn’t resume, there will\nalways be frozen chicken.\nAnd if it does, there could well be\nfuture disruptions to supply,\nwhether due to domestic policy or\ndisease.\nAs Covid-19, the Ukraine war and\nrecent climate changes show,\nsupply chain disruptions will be\nhere to stay. Our best response is\nto ensure we continue to have a\nrange of options and choices, and\nto adjust to them.\nAnd as alternative plant-based\nchicken substitutes from\nOmniMeat to Tindle become\nincreasingly common on\nsupermarket shelves, they are\nworth trying out.\nAt least you know what you\nmight be able to adapt to.\nzakirh@sph.com.sgThinking Aloud\nChicken, climate\nand choices in\na food crunch\nSupply chain disruptions are here\nto stay – our best response is to\nensure we have a range of options\nand are able to adjust when needed\nSingaporeans may have to\nadjust to the fact that fresh\nchicken like we are used to,\nferried over daily from\nfarms in Johor and beyond,\nslaughtered at local\nabattoirs and then shipped\nto wet markets and\nsupermarkets islandwide,\nmight one day be a thing of\nthe past.\nPublication: The Straits Times\nDate: 19 June 2022\nHeadline: Chicken, climate and\nchoices in a food crunch\nSource: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.
