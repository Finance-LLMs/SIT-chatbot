    "The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) is a four-year direct honours programme designed and delivered via our pioneering competency-based education approach. This programme aims to train skilled professionals for Singapore's electronics industry and other sectors that require electrical and electronics engineers.",
    "The BEng EEE programme will equip students with robust technical expertise in electrical and electronic engineering, which is essential for addressing complex engineering challenges in our digitally interconnected world. Students will acquire competencies in areas such as data analytics, operational excellence, sustainable energy systems, and semiconductor manufacturing, empowering them to design and develop systems, devices, and technologies pivotal to our daily lives.",
    "These are skills required to meet the needs of industries like energy and power, electronics manufacturing, telecommunications, and engineering services—essentially, fields where electrical and electronic systems play a key role. These sectors are closely linked to three domains, namely (i) Manufacturing, Trade & Connectivity; (ii) Urban Solutions & Sustainability; and (iii) Smart Nation & Digital Economy identified in Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE 2025) plans where strong demand for engineers with the relevant knowledge and skills to implement emerging technologies is expected.",
    "The EEE programme includes industry demand-led specialisations such as Semiconductor Manufacturing, with input from major semiconductor companies and EDB Singapore.",
    "Competency-based Education",
    "The EEE programme is the first-of-its-kind engineering degree programme delivered through the CBE approach. This approach emphasises practical mastery of key competencies, shifting away from traditional academic curricula. The curriculum comprises a blend of modules and learning blocks, specifically designed to help students acquire and master skills that are directly applicable to real-world engineering problems.",
    "Each learning block is self-contained to train students to acquire a set of related competencies. It includes an integrated project based on real-world scenarios, allowing students to apply and demonstrate their newly acquired competencies.",
    "Some examples of the learning blocks in the EEE programme include Electronic Systems, Sensing & Actuation, and Semiconductor Manufacturing & Process Control.",
    "Integrated Work Study Programme",
    "The BEng EEE degree programme includes an 8-month Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP). SIT works closely with its industry partners to ensure students develop professional competencies through the IWSP, which complements industry capstone and applied research projects. The BEng EEE is built on the Skills Framework and Industry Transformation Maps, launched to meet the evolving needs of Singapore’s engineering industries, ensuring alignment with national priorities and sector demands. Key competencies such as data analytics, operational excellence, semiconductor manufacturing, and sustainable energy systems are taught, equipping graduates with the skills that employers value most.",
