    "There has been much discussion about building a smart nation, a smart home, and even a smart factory. You would also probably have heard terms like Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, and even Industrial Internet of Things.",
    "So, what are all these, and how can we build our own IoT solution? This beginner-level 2-day workshop is aimed at introducing participants to the Internet of Things (IoT) and the building blocks for such a solution. Topics will include embedded programming, IoT implementation, and mobile app development.",
    "There will also be hands-on sessions that allow participants to gain a better appreciation of the contents taught. At the end of this course, each participant will bring home the whole learning kit they used in class so that they can continue to practise IoT solutions at home or at work.",
    "To aid companies in transforming their capabilities through their human capital and support Singapore’s drive towards becoming a smart nation, this course is mapped to the Singapore Economic Development Board’s Singapore Smart Industry Readiness Index, Dimension 7 Shopfloor Connectivity.",

    "Basic embedded system programming",
    "A cost-effective and powerful microcontroller with a built-in communication module will be introduced. Participants will learn how to create their firmware to capture sensors’ readings and control actuators. They will also learn how to make use of the communication module to connect to the internet",
    "Integrating with IoT platform (cloud solution)",
    "In this beginner-level workshop, we will not be building our own IoT platform but instead, a free-online platform will be used. Participants will learn about the communication protocols necessary to push and extract data to and from this platform",
    "Mobile app development",
    "An online graphical-based Android app development tool will be introduced so that participants with little or no programming knowledge can quickly learn how to create apps that can interact with the IoT platform for data exchange and control of their embedded system",
