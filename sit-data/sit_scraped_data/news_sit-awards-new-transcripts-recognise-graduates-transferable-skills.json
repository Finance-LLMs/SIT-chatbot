    "For the first time, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is awarding the Record of Transferable Skills (RTS) transcripts to Class of 2024 graduates from two programmes – Digital Communications and Integrated Media (DCIM), and Nursing. From next year, the RTS will be awarded to all graduating students. This, together with their academic transcripts, showcases the graduate's holistic development at SIT.",
    "The RTS is an integral component of SIT’s Industry Ready Skills Framework (IRSF). This framework seamlessly integrates structured transferable skills training into both the formal curriculum and co-curricular activities. Initially piloted in Academic Year 2021 and fully implemented across all undergraduate programmes from Academic Year 2022, the IRSF underscores SIT’s commitment to equipping its graduates with not only academic qualifications but also industry-relevant transferable skills that will empower them to thrive in a rapidly evolving workforce.

    "The introduction of the RTS transcript marks a bold step forward in how SIT enhances the employability of its graduates. Complementing their academic credentials, the transcript documents the student’s mastery of 18 key transferable skills identified as critical for success in today’s dynamic job market. These essential skills, drawn from the SkillsFuture Critical Core Skills framework and aligned with the World Economic Forum's top 10 in-demand skills",

    "Professor Chua Kee Chaing, President of SIT,",
    "remarked,  “Our degree programmes are designed to equip students with a deep and comprehensive knowledge base while fostering adaptability and relevance in an ever-evolving industry landscape. The RTS facilitates the student's skills development by mapping out skill areas and proficiency levels as they progress in their education journey so that the student can identify areas to focus on for a more holistic development. The RTS transcript is a key step in recognising our students’ broader capabilities beyond academic qualifications. It reflects our commitment to shaping graduates who are not just industry-ready, but future-ready.”",
    "\"In today’s fast-evolving digital landscape, transferable skills are just as vital as technical expertise. At NCS, we value talent with strong soft skills like critical thinking, communication and problem-solving, which are essential for innovation and collaboration in our fast-paced environment. The RTS transcript offers a valuable complement to academic credentials, giving employers deeper insight into a graduate’s capabilities. This initiative helps companies identify talent who are both technically proficient and adaptable for our rapidly changing industry. SIT's commitment to fostering well-rounded graduates is wonderful and aligns closely with the industry's growing demand for talent capable of navigating both present challenges and future opportunities,\" said",

As the need for speech therapists grows due to our ageing population and increasing demand for early intervention for children with special needs, the SLT programme is essential for building a local pipeline of speech therapists. Developed by esteemed clinical practitioners and in collaboration with partners from the social and health sectors such as SKH, this programme is tailored to address elderly and paediatric communication and swallowing difficulties and includes practical placements in local settings. By Integrating national initiatives like the National One-Rehabilitation Framework and EatSafe SG, graduates are well-prepared to contribute meaningfully to our community.”",

From next year, the RTS will be awarded to all graduating students. This, together with their academic transcripts, showcases the graduate's holistic development at SIT.\nThe RTS is an integral component of SIT’s Industry Ready Skills Framework (IRSF). This framework seamlessly integrates structured transferable skills training into both the formal curriculum and co-curricular activities. Initially piloted in Academic Year 2021 and fully implemented across all undergraduate programmes from Academic Year 2022, the IRSF underscores SIT’s commitment to equipping its graduates with not only academic qualifications but also industry-relevant transferable skills that will empower them to thrive in a rapidly evolving workforce. For more information on the IRSF, please visit:\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/why-sit/university-programme-structure/irsf\n.\nRecognising Skills for the Future\nA sample of the RTS transcript: The radar chart (left) shows the average score of all skills under each skill area. The table (right) lists the 18 transferable skills attained by the level of proficiency, ranging from emerging to proficient to highly proficient.\nThe introduction of the RTS transcript marks a bold step forward in how SIT enhances the employability of its graduates. Complementing their academic credentials, the transcript documents the student’s mastery of 18 key transferable skills identified as critical for success in today’s dynamic job market. These essential skills, drawn from the SkillsFuture Critical Core Skills framework and aligned with the World Economic Forum's top 10 in-demand skills\n[1]\n, enhance employability as employers gain better knowledge of a graduate’s capabilities in areas such as critical thinking, communication and adaptability.\nProfessor Chua Kee Chaing, President of SIT,\nremarked,  “Our degree programmes are designed to equip students with a deep and comprehensive knowledge base while fostering adaptability and relevance in an ever-evolving industry landscape. The RTS facilitates the student's skills development by mapping out skill areas and proficiency levels as they progress in their education journey so that the student can identify areas to focus on for a more holistic development. The RTS transcript is a key step in recognising our students’ broader capabilities beyond academic qualifications. It reflects our commitment to shaping graduates who are not just industry-ready, but future-ready.”\n\"In today’s fast-evolving digital landscape, transferable skills are just as vital as technical expertise. At NCS, we value talent with strong soft skills like critical thinking, communication and problem-solving, which are essential for innovation and collaboration in our fast-paced environment. The RTS transcript offers a valuable complement to academic credentials, giving employers deeper insight into a graduate’s capabilities. This initiative helps companies identify talent who are both technically proficient and adaptable for our rapidly changing industry. SIT's commitment to fostering well-rounded graduates is wonderful and aligns closely with the industry's growing demand for talent capable of navigating both present challenges and future opportunities,\" said\nHowie Lau, Managing Director, Corporate Development & Partnerships, NCS Group\n, and Chairperson of the Industry Advisory Committee for SIT’s DCIM degree programme.\nBreaking New Ground with Singapore’s First Speech and Language Therapy Degree\nMr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education\n,\ndelivered his\nConvocation Address\nat the main session of the SIT Convocation 2024.\n(Photo: SIT and Keng Photography)\nThe achievements of the Class of 2024 will be celebrated over nine sessions from 16 to 18 October 2024 at Convocation 2024. This year, over 2,800 graduates from around 50 undergraduate and postgraduate programmes will receive their degrees. Among them are 1,359 graduates from SIT-conferred degree programmes, 1,289 from joint-degree programmes with SIT’s overseas university partners, and 159 from programmes of SIT’s overseas university partners. Guest-of-Honour Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education, graced the first ceremony.\nThis year’s convocation also features the pioneer cohort of graduates from six programmes:\nProgramme\nNumber of Graduates\nBachelor of Science with Honours in Speech and Language Therapy (SLT)\n27\nBachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science in Interactive Media and Game Development (IMGD), a joint programme with DigiPen Institute of Technology (DigiPen)\n57\nBachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation (RTIS), a joint programme with DigiPen\n61\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Electronics and Data Engineering (EDE), a joint programme with the Technical University of Munich (TUM)\n48\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Chemical Engineering, a joint programme with TUM\n38\nMaster of Engineering (MEng)\n4\nThe results from SIT’s preliminary employment survey of this year’s graduating cohort are encouraging, with nearly two-thirds securing employment before graduation. An average of over 75% of the pioneer cohort of graduates from the six programmes have already secured employment.\n[2]\nSIT’s SLT programme is Singapore’s first undergraduate degree programme in Speech and Language Therapy, designed to meet the growing national demand for qualified professionals in this field. Developed in close collaboration with healthcare professionals, the programme equips students with the knowledge and clinical expertise needed to deliver essential services across various healthcare settings. Through partnerships with over 25 organisations, the programme provides students with extensive hands-on experience through clinical placements.\nWhile the employment of allied health professionals in Singapore has grown by 25% from 2019 to 2023\n[3]\n, the lengthy waiting time for speech and language therapy services in both the healthcare and community sectors still reflects a rising demand for Speech-Language Therapists. The programme’s pioneer graduating cohort of 27 students demonstrates SIT’s vital role in meeting this need, with 92% of the cohort having secured employment or started work in various sectors.\nAdjunct Associate Professor Melissa Chua, Head of Speech Therapy and Deputy Director, Allied Health at Sengkang General Hospital,\nsaid, “SIT is a key industry partner of Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) due to our proximity to its new Punggol Campus. As the need for speech therapists grows due to our ageing population and increasing demand for early intervention for children with special needs, the SLT programme is essential for building a local pipeline of speech therapists. Developed by esteemed clinical practitioners and in collaboration with partners from the social and health sectors such as SKH, this programme is tailored to address elderly and paediatric communication and swallowing difficulties and includes practical placements in local settings. By Integrating national initiatives like the National One-Rehabilitation Framework and EatSafe SG, graduates are well-prepared to contribute meaningfully to our community.”\nGrowing Talent Pipelines for Innovation and Digital Economies\n(From left) Mr Bill Chang, Chairman, Board of Trustees, SIT; Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education; and Prof Chua Kee Chaing, President, SIT. (Photo: SIT and Keng Photography)\nSIT is celebrating the first graduates from its new joint degree programmes with TUM and DigiPen. These programmes address Singapore’s evolving talent needs in areas such as data analytics, digital systems, additive manufacturing and gaming. With 207 graduates across these four joint degree programmes, SIT continues to bolster Singapore’s digital economy, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to excel in sectors that are vital to Singapore’s digital transformation.\nSince the first intake in January 2024, the MEng, an Industrial Masters programme, has enrolled 15 students, with the first batch of four graduates already contributing to their respective industries. Through partnerships with companies such as NVIDIA, Woh Hup, and SingHealth, MEng students have worked on cutting-edge research projects\n[4]\nthat address real-world challenges. These partnerships have not only enhanced students' learning experiences but have also provided tangible benefits to the participating companies, such as filling critical skills gaps and driving innovation in business practices. The impact of the MEng programme extends beyond academia, fostering a strong talent pipeline essential for sustaining Singapore’s technological and economic growth.\n[1]\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/05/future-of-jobs-2023-skills/\n[2]\nData is accurate as of 30 August 2024 and obtained from the Class of 2024 who responded to the preliminary employment survey conducted by SIT.\n[3]\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/allied-healthcare-professionals-25-increase-moh-growing-demand-4151981\n[4]\nExamples of MEng projects include:\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/news/constructing-strong-foundation-green-buildings\n, and\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/news/building-sustainable-future-one-beam-time\n.\nTopics\nAllied Health\nEngineering\nChemical Engineering\nGraduation\nCATEGORIES\nPress Releases\nEducation\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nWhy SMEs Should Tap on IHLs for Upskilling Needs\nview\nNext\nClass of 2024: Shaping New Chapters Through Lifelong Learning\nview\nRelated News\n01 Apr 2025\nABS and the Singapore Institute of Technology Sign Strategic Agreement to Explore Innovation in Applied Research and Talent Development\nAdvancing Cutting-Edge Maritime Technologies and Nurturing Industry-Ready Talent\ntag\nPress Releases, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering\n06 Jan 2025\nSIT Introduces Singapore’s First Competency-Based Undergraduate Engineering Degrees and a Unique Interdisciplinary Business Programme\nSIT pioneers Competency-based Education (CBE) for Engineering undergraduates with two new degree programmes in Academic Year 2025.\ntag\nPress Releases, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design\n18 Sep 2024\nOCBC to Invest $500 Million in Punggol Digital District\nInvestment includes a multi-million-dollar strategic partnership with SIT\ntag\nPress Releases, Industry & Community, Academic Clusters, Business, Communication and Design, Infocomm Technology"
