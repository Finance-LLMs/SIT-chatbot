    "Student-chef Jasper Loh struck gold and silver medals at the prestigious IKA/Culinary Olympics 2024.",
    "Team captain Jasper Loh (fourth from left) and Team Manager Elvin Chew (fifth from left) with the team at the IKA/Culinary Olympics 2024. The 26th edition of the competition, held between 2-7 February, saw the Singapore Junior National Team clinching Gold for the 'Chef's Table' and Silver for the 'Restaurant of Nations' categories, respectively. (Photo: Singapore Chefs Association)",
    "The proposition was hard to resist – a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to represent Singapore at the IKA/Culinary Olympics 2024 – the world’s largest international exhibition of culinary skills – in Stuttgart, Germany. Even though Jasper Loh, who completed the Diploma in Baking and Culinary Science at Temasek Polytechnic, had no experience in competitive cooking, he instinctively said yes when his poly lecturer offered him the chance to participate.",
    "“I knew the preparation for the competition would disrupt my university studies, but it was a unique experience that would make me stand out in the long run,” said the Year 1 student pursuing a degree in",
    "Food Business Management (Culinary Arts)",
    ", offered by The Culinary Institute of America (CIA), the world’s premier culinary college, through SIT.",
    "For five months prior to the competition in February 2024, Jasper and his mates from the Singapore Junior National Team spent almost every day preparing for the big day. After weekday classes that ended at 6 pm, the 23-year-old would head to an external training kitchen to practise cooking and leave just in time to catch the last train home. Saturdays meant a full day of training.",
    "Leading the Team to Success",
    "As Team Captain, Jasper ensured the team stayed cohesive and harmonious. \"Creating a family-like atmosphere among team members where we enjoy each other's company was the first step. It wasn't my role to be the most skillful in every task, and it was a responsibility to bond the team and showcase their full potential at the competition,” said Jasper.",
    "Like a well-drilled sports team, members of the Junior Team pulled their weight in their respective cook stations while keeping their eye on putting together the best dishes that would wow the judges.",
    "Aside from Jasper, the under-25 team consisted of a manager, five other team members and two assistants. Some, like Jasper, are culinary students, while others work in professional kitchens.",
    "Their task was to develop, prepare and execute a menu for two competition categories: Chef’s Table and Restaurant of Nations. In the former, the team served a nine-course meal to a panel of 12 guests, and in the latter category, they served three courses to 70 guests from all over the world. It took 5 hours to prepare the dishes as a team and serve the guests.",
    "Their hard work paid off. The Singapore Junior National Team was awarded",
    "Gold for Chef’s Table and Silver for Restaurant of Nations",
    ". It was no mean feat as it was the first time in two decades that Singapore sent a Junior Team for this esteemed competition, held once every four years.",
    "It Takes a Village",
    "“Our mentors drove us to do our best,” shared Jasper, referring to celebrated local chefs Yew Eng Tong and Nixon Low, who took time off their busy schedules to conduct the training.",
    "“Their past competition experiences and culinary expertise speak volumes. We see how passionate they are when coming up with components for the dishes. The passion rubs off on the team.”He also credits his team manager and culinary consultant Elvin Chew, and assistant manager cum CIA alumni Ong Jing Qin for the squad’s outstanding performance.",
    "Equally important was the support of his CIA lecturers and course mates, stressed Jasper, who had their blessing to skip some classes and take on a smaller role in group projects due to his packed schedule. His kitchen lessons also armed him with the soft skills needed to be a team captain.",
    "In the kitchen hierarchy, the sous chef reports to the executive chef and manages all kitchen staff and kitchen operations. Jasper gets to play the role of sous chef during classes, which helps develop his leadership and communication skills. (Photo: Jasper Loh)",
    "“We are given ample opportunities to lead the class as a sous chef, which allows us to grow and get comfortable with being in that unfamiliar spot.”",
    "Test of Adaptability and Quick Wits",
    "For Chef's Table, the team opted for the raw theme where foods were plated in natural shapes. For example, braised beef was plated to look like a tree stump. The team served Chicken Roulade with Foie Gras Risotto alongside carrot pudding and Souffle for Restaurant of Nations.",
    "(From left, top and bottom): Carrot pudding, Souffle and Chicken Roulade with Foie Gras Risotto that was served for Restaurant of Nations. (Photo: Jasper Loh)",
    "Braving through an international event like the IKA/Culinary Olympics certainly came with its fair share of lessons. In addition to teaching the team endurance, the competition was a test of adaptability and quick wits.",
    "Jasper heating up the carrot puree to form the carrot pudding at the IKA/Culinary Olympics 2024. (Photo: Jasper Loh)",
    "Case in point: They could not accurately gauge whether the carrot pudding they had planned to serve was ready to be set in the mould. It turned out mushy instead of firm. “We had to come up with a new way to present the dish in a half doughnut mould instead, 20 minutes before it had to be served to 70 guests.”",
    "Being able to hold the team together and stay strong despite being new to the experience was also a challenge for Jasper. “Thankfully, my manager was a pillar of support throughout the journey,” he recalled.",
    "The IKA/Culinary Olympics may have been a large feather added to his cap, but Jasper has his sights set further on the horizon. “I want to gain as much experience as I can in various kitchens across different countries,” said Jasper, who started getting job stints in professional kitchens in secondary school and prepared meals for his family of five on special occasions as a primary school student.",
    "Now back in the swing of academic life, the affable student is looking forward to more opportunities to connect with former CIA graduates who regularly visit campus as guests.",
    "“I am looking forward to going on a year-long attachment with a US restaurant in the third year of my studies. The IKA/Culinary Olympics has given me so much exposure, and this degree programme is my gateway to explore the world.”",

The 26th edition of the competition, held between 2-7 February, saw the Singapore Junior National Team clinching Gold for the 'Chef's Table' and Silver for the 'Restaurant of Nations' categories, respectively. (Photo: Singapore Chefs Association)\nThe proposition was hard to resist – a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to represent Singapore at the IKA/Culinary Olympics 2024 – the world’s largest international exhibition of culinary skills – in Stuttgart, Germany. Even though Jasper Loh, who completed the Diploma in Baking and Culinary Science at Temasek Polytechnic, had no experience in competitive cooking, he instinctively said yes when his poly lecturer offered him the chance to participate.\n“I knew the preparation for the competition would disrupt my university studies, but it was a unique experience that would make me stand out in the long run,” said the Year 1 student pursuing a degree in\nFood Business Management (Culinary Arts)\n, offered by The Culinary Institute of America (CIA), the world’s premier culinary college, through SIT.\nFor five months prior to the competition in February 2024, Jasper and his mates from the Singapore Junior National Team spent almost every day preparing for the big day. After weekday classes that ended at 6 pm, the 23-year-old would head to an external training kitchen to practise cooking and leave just in time to catch the last train home. Saturdays meant a full day of training.\nLeading the Team to Success\nAs Team Captain, Jasper ensured the team stayed cohesive and harmonious. \"Creating a family-like atmosphere among team members where we enjoy each other's company was the first step. It wasn't my role to be the most skillful in every task, and it was a responsibility to bond the team and showcase their full potential at the competition,” said Jasper.\nLike a well-drilled sports team, members of the Junior Team pulled their weight in their respective cook stations while keeping their eye on putting together the best dishes that would wow the judges.\nAside from Jasper, the under-25 team consisted of a manager, five other team members and two assistants. Some, like Jasper, are culinary students, while others work in professional kitchens.\nTheir task was to develop, prepare and execute a menu for two competition categories: Chef’s Table and Restaurant of Nations. In the former, the team served a nine-course meal to a panel of 12 guests, and in the latter category, they served three courses to 70 guests from all over the world. It took 5 hours to prepare the dishes as a team and serve the guests.\nTheir hard work paid off. The Singapore Junior National Team was awarded\nGold for Chef’s Table and Silver for Restaurant of Nations\n. It was no mean feat as it was the first time in two decades that Singapore sent a Junior Team for this esteemed competition, held once every four years.\nIt Takes a Village\n“Our mentors drove us to do our best,” shared Jasper, referring to celebrated local chefs Yew Eng Tong and Nixon Low, who took time off their busy schedules to conduct the training.\n“Their past competition experiences and culinary expertise speak volumes. We see how passionate they are when coming up with components for the dishes. The passion rubs off on the team.”He also credits his team manager and culinary consultant Elvin Chew, and assistant manager cum CIA alumni Ong Jing Qin for the squad’s outstanding performance.\nEqually important was the support of his CIA lecturers and course mates, stressed Jasper, who had their blessing to skip some classes and take on a smaller role in group projects due to his packed schedule. His kitchen lessons also armed him with the soft skills needed to be a team captain.\nIn the kitchen hierarchy, the sous chef reports to the executive chef and manages all kitchen staff and kitchen operations. Jasper gets to play the role of sous chef during classes, which helps develop his leadership and communication skills. (Photo: Jasper Loh)\n“We are given ample opportunities to lead the class as a sous chef, which allows us to grow and get comfortable with being in that unfamiliar spot.”\nTest of Adaptability and Quick Wits\nFor Chef's Table, the team opted for the raw theme where foods were plated in natural shapes. For example, braised beef was plated to look like a tree stump. The team served Chicken Roulade with Foie Gras Risotto alongside carrot pudding and Souffle for Restaurant of Nations.\n(From left, top and bottom): Carrot pudding, Souffle and Chicken Roulade with Foie Gras Risotto that was served for Restaurant of Nations. (Photo: Jasper Loh)\nBraving through an international event like the IKA/Culinary Olympics certainly came with its fair share of lessons. In addition to teaching the team endurance, the competition was a test of adaptability and quick wits.\nJasper heating up the carrot puree to form the carrot pudding at the IKA/Culinary Olympics 2024. (Photo: Jasper Loh)\nCase in point: They could not accurately gauge whether the carrot pudding they had planned to serve was ready to be set in the mould. It turned out mushy instead of firm. “We had to come up with a new way to present the dish in a half doughnut mould instead, 20 minutes before it had to be served to 70 guests.”\nBeing able to hold the team together and stay strong despite being new to the experience was also a challenge for Jasper. “Thankfully, my manager was a pillar of support throughout the journey,” he recalled.\nThe IKA/Culinary Olympics may have been a large feather added to his cap, but Jasper has his sights set further on the horizon. “I want to gain as much experience as I can in various kitchens across different countries,” said Jasper, who started getting job stints in professional kitchens in secondary school and prepared meals for his family of five on special occasions as a primary school student.\nNow back in the swing of academic life, the affable student is looking forward to more opportunities to connect with former CIA graduates who regularly visit campus as guests.\n“I am looking forward to going on a year-long attachment with a US restaurant in the third year of my studies. The IKA/Culinary Olympics has given me so much exposure, and this degree programme is my gateway to explore the world.”\nTopics\nSuccess Stories\nCIA Singapore\nCulinary Arts\nAwards\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nBusiness, Communication and Design\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nSIT’s Singapore Biodesign Faculty Fellows Turn Research into Medical Solutions\nview\nNext\nNavigating Risks and Uncertainties in a Post-COVID World\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences"
