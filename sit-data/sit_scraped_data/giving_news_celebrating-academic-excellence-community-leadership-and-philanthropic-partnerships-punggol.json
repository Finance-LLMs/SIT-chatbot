    "Celebrating Academic Excellence, Community Leadership and Philanthropic Partnerships in Punggol",
    "A fresh chapter, as the tenth edition of the Recognition of Excellence (ROE) unfolded its inaugural presentation in SIT’s new campus in the Punggol Digital District.",
    "12 December 2024",
    "A cause for both merit and celebration – as the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) recognises high-performing student achievement and the philanthropic support to nurture student excellence. The annual Recognition of Excellence presentation, held for the first time at the Ho Bee Auditorium on 27 November in Punggol campus, saw 61 named scholarships being presented to 222 recipients. This is in addition to the 141 Gold Medals, Yearly Performance Awards, Outstanding Student Awards, and Book Prizes awarded in the Academic Year 2024/25.",
    "Extending a warm welcome to the guests, Professor John Thong, Deputy President (Academic) & Provost, SIT (left), expressed gratitude to the donors for their unwavering and generous support. He noted that the outstanding performance of SITizens has enabled them to thrive in the workforce and make their marks across diverse industries, strengthening SIT’s goal of developing adaptable professionals for a dynamic future.",
    "In his address, Professor Chua Kee Chaing, President, SIT (second from left), highlighted the tremendous impact of donors’ philanthropic leadership. Their contributions over the past decade have enabled SIT to award more than 8,900 scholarships, student excellence awards and various forms of financial aid. These initiatives have levelled the playing field, created opportunities and opened new horizons for students. Prof Chua also shared his vision of the Punggol Campus as a vibrant hub for alumni and community engagement, achieved through initiatives such as SIT’s “Learn for Life” and partnerships with local secondary schools to use STEM skills to solve real-world problems.",
    "Mr Felix Tan (second from left), a Year 3 Accountancy student and recipient of the KKH Scholarship, who shared about his unconventional journey from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) to University at the event, is deeply grateful to the donors who have made the scholarships possible. He added, “Your generosity has motivated me to strive for greater achievements during my time at SIT. My presence here today is not solely a reflection of my successes, but also a testament to the numerous challenges I have faced and the unwavering support I have received from those around me.”",
    "As the event winded down, the atmosphere was filled with laughter and vibrant discussions as donors, students, and senior management engaged in conversations and enjoyed the reception – all against a backdrop of lush greenery with an unobstructed and scenic view of Coney Island and Sungei Serangoon.",
    "An appreciative audience, as ROE 2024 kicked off with a lively performance by SIT’s D’Streak Flo.",
    "The ceremony goes into full swing, as Prof Thong presented the scholarships, followed by a student sharing session.",
    "Scholarship recipients catching up with donors outside the new Ho Bee Auditorium at the reception and photo taking.",
    "All work and no play makes Jack and Jill dull boys and girls, but certainly not our SITizens as they posed gamely for pictures!",
