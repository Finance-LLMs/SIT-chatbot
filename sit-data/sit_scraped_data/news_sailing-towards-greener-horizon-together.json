    "How SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.",
    "FSSD Programme Letter of Award signing ceremony held at the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) in July 2024. Representatives from MPA, SIT, NUS, TCOMS, NTU, and IHPC were present. (Photo: Tan Cheng Peng)",
    "The once familiar roar and fumes of diesel engines are no longer, replaced by a pervasive, low electric hum and a clear refreshing scent of the sea breeze. Powerful electric tugboats operate with near silence, skilfully nudging and guiding massive containerships towards their designated berths. Sleek and modern harbour craft criss-cross smoothly over the waves, efficiently shuttling people and supplies to and from the numerous large vessels anchored further out in the port waters. This constant yet quiet ballet of electric harbour craft defines the bustling efficiency of Singapore’s transformed maritime hub. This is what the future of Singapore’s maritime and shipping industry could look like.",
    "The maritime sector, long reliant on fossil fuels, is undergoing a seismic shift and is moving towards greener and more sustainable ship operations. Global efforts are underway, and Singapore, one of the world's busiest ports, is taking bold steps toward decarbonisation.",
    "SIT is playing an active role in this transition. Through applied research, capability building, and close collaboration with industry stakeholders, SIT is helping to support the development of electric harbour craft and more sustainable maritime solutions.",
    "Docking Into the Future",
    "Decarbonising the maritime sector presents complex challenges, including technological, operational, and financial obstacles. To address these, SIT is leading the",
    "Future Ship and System Design (FSSD)",
    "programme, which focuses on three key areas: sustainable ship and system design, efficient charging infrastructure and onshore microgrid, as well as intelligent ships and operations to lower the total cost of ownership of using electric harbour craft, drive higher operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Launched in collaboration with the Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and the Singapore Maritime Institute (SMI), the FSSD programme aims to accelerate the adoption of electric harbour craft – ships powered by electricity rather than diesel engines – through research and development (R&D) efforts.",
    "Speaking at Singapore Maritime Week 2025 in March,",
    "Associate Professor Tay Chuan Beng",
    ", Acting Cluster Director of Engineering at SIT, addressed the challenges of introducing electric harbour craft into Singapore’s maritime ecosystem. These challenges include developing adequate charging infrastructure, managing electricity costs, and advancing intelligent ship systems.",
    "A/Prof Tay Chuan Beng, Acting Cluster Director of Engineering at SIT, gave a talk about the FSSD programme at the Singapore Maritime Week 2025 in March. (Photo: SIT)",
    "“Stakeholders require new ways of thinking and working across the different life cycles of a harbour craft so that besides business liability, we can also maintain the safety, reliability, and availability of Singapore’s harbour craft services,” said A/Prof Tay.",
    "Since its inception in July 2024, the FSSD programme has successfully evaluated 11 proposals",
    "[1]",
    "for passenger launches and cargo lighter vessels, he noted. The five-year programme has been well-received by industry professionals, securing $7.7 million",
    "[2]",
    "in contributions from 16 industry collaborators on top of its original $20 million funding from SMI.",
    "A research facility, the FSSD Laboratory, funded by SMI and MPA, has also been set up at SIT’s Punggol Campus. The lab serves as a dynamic research hub for the development and testing of innovative maritime technologies. With over 20 research staff and postgraduate students already on board, the FSSD Lab is envisioned as a collaborative platform where industry partners, researchers, and students converge to co-develop technologies that will shape the design and operations of the next generation of harbour craft.",
    "A/Prof Tay shared updates on the FSSD programme at the FSSD Lab Industry Partner Day on 21 March 2025. (Photo: SIT)",
    "The lab is equipped with industry-standard research equipment, including two advanced test rigs donated by global aerospace leader Rolls-Royce. These test rigs will help simulate real-life ship operations to aid research efforts, thereby enhancing research efforts and providing practical learning experiences.",
    "One of them is a microgrid simulator that will simulate real-world charging conditions using renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. This allows researchers to test and optimise onshore Energy Management Systems (EMS) that coordinate energy flow between batteries, solar panels, the national grid, and shore chargers – essential for lowering charging costs and improving availability for electric harbour craft.",
    "The Microgrid Simulator (right, against the wall) at the FSSD Laboratory replicates an onshore energy ecosystem, integrating renewable sources, battery storage, and grid supply. The screens (left) show the OASIS platform, which is used to simulate and test autonomous ship navigation and onboard systems in a virtual environment. (Photo: SIT)",
    "Another is a System Health Management and Equipment Health Monitoring test rig, which simulates a shipboard electrical propulsion system. Its flexible and modular design allows it to represent fully electric and hybrid-electric configurations, with the added capability to simulate equipment faults and wear-and-tear. This enables the development of intelligent fault detection systems and predictive maintenance strategies, which are key to improving electric vessels’ safety, efficiency and uptime.",
    "What sets the FSSD Lab apart is its dual focus on research and applied learning. SIT undergraduates and adult learners will gain direct exposure to the same systems used by professionals in the field, bridging the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world maritime application. Through this immersive experience, students not only learn to use advanced technologies but also contribute meaningfully to solving key industry challenges.",
    "All Hands On Deck",
    "While R&D can help speed up the development of technology and equipment to green the maritime industry, real progress hinges on strong collaboration in the maritime ecosystem. The challenges of decarbonising the sector – from cost pressures to technical complexity – require not just innovation in the lab, but practical input from those working at sea, shipyards, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), system integrators, classification societies and financial institutions.",
    "To bridge this gap, SIT actively engages maritime partners such as local electric vessel maker Pyxis for their professional expertise. The learning goes both ways, with Pyxis tapping on SIT’s deep research capabilities in areas such as vessel electrification, efficiency optimisation, and smart energy management. In return, SIT students and faculty gain valuable exposure to the operational realities and challenges of deploying electric harbour craft in Singapore’s busy port ecosystem. Pyxis and SIT are also working together to develop future maritime professionals through SIT’s Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) – an eight- to 12-month-long internship that gives students exposure to industry outside of the classroom.",
    "Foreground: A/Prof Tay (left) with Pyxis founder Mr Tommy Phun (right) at FSSD Lab Industry Partner Day on 21 March. (Photo: SIT)",
    "“Through the many collaborations, we have had the opportunity to work with talented SIT individuals who bring fresh perspectives, technical knowledge, and a hands-on approach to problem-solving,” said Pyxis founder Mr Tommy Phun.",
    "Such collaborations are critical to tackling real-world industry challenges, acknowledged A/Prof Tay. “We must work closely with the industry to find practical and cost-effective solutions towards our net-zero goals,” he said.",
    "Mr Phun agreed, “As the maritime industry continues to evolve, we believe that sustained collaboration with forward-thinking academic institutions like SIT will be key to driving impactful change in maritime sustainability.”",
    "SIT’s engagement with the maritime industry remains strong, with plans for a new research lab with Seatrium, a premier global marine and offshore solutions provider. Known as the Offshore & Marine Digital Learning Lab, it will drive the efficiency, sustainability and innovation of yard operations, energy microgrids and remote collaborations through artificial intelligence,",
    "data analytics, and simulation models. Like the FSSD Lab, it will also offer immersive, hands-on learning for SIT students.",
    "“Decarbonising the carbon sector to electrification is a complex and difficult undertaking, but by working together, we can make this a reality,” said A/Prof Tay.",

Representatives from MPA, SIT, NUS, TCOMS, NTU, and IHPC were present. (Photo: Tan Cheng Peng)\nThe once familiar roar and fumes of diesel engines are no longer, replaced by a pervasive, low electric hum and a clear refreshing scent of the sea breeze. Powerful electric tugboats operate with near silence, skilfully nudging and guiding massive containerships towards their designated berths. Sleek and modern harbour craft criss-cross smoothly over the waves, efficiently shuttling people and supplies to and from the numerous large vessels anchored further out in the port waters. This constant yet quiet ballet of electric harbour craft defines the bustling efficiency of Singapore’s transformed maritime hub. This is what the future of Singapore’s maritime and shipping industry could look like.\nThe maritime sector, long reliant on fossil fuels, is undergoing a seismic shift and is moving towards greener and more sustainable ship operations. Global efforts are underway, and Singapore, one of the world's busiest ports, is taking bold steps toward decarbonisation.\nSIT is playing an active role in this transition. Through applied research, capability building, and close collaboration with industry stakeholders, SIT is helping to support the development of electric harbour craft and more sustainable maritime solutions.\nDocking Into the Future\nDecarbonising the maritime sector presents complex challenges, including technological, operational, and financial obstacles. To address these, SIT is leading the\nFuture Ship and System Design (FSSD)\nprogramme, which focuses on three key areas: sustainable ship and system design, efficient charging infrastructure and onshore microgrid, as well as intelligent ships and operations to lower the total cost of ownership of using electric harbour craft, drive higher operational efficiencies and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nLaunched in collaboration with the Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and the Singapore Maritime Institute (SMI), the FSSD programme aims to accelerate the adoption of electric harbour craft – ships powered by electricity rather than diesel engines – through research and development (R&D) efforts.\nSpeaking at Singapore Maritime Week 2025 in March,\nAssociate Professor Tay Chuan Beng\n, Acting Cluster Director of Engineering at SIT, addressed the challenges of introducing electric harbour craft into Singapore’s maritime ecosystem. These challenges include developing adequate charging infrastructure, managing electricity costs, and advancing intelligent ship systems.\nA/Prof Tay Chuan Beng, Acting Cluster Director of Engineering at SIT, gave a talk about the FSSD programme at the Singapore Maritime Week 2025 in March. (Photo: SIT)\n“Stakeholders require new ways of thinking and working across the different life cycles of a harbour craft so that besides business liability, we can also maintain the safety, reliability, and availability of Singapore’s harbour craft services,” said A/Prof Tay.\nSince its inception in July 2024, the FSSD programme has successfully evaluated 11 proposals\n[1]\nfor passenger launches and cargo lighter vessels, he noted. The five-year programme has been well-received by industry professionals, securing $7.7 million\n[2]\nin contributions from 16 industry collaborators on top of its original $20 million funding from SMI.\nA research facility, the FSSD Laboratory, funded by SMI and MPA, has also been set up at SIT’s Punggol Campus. The lab serves as a dynamic research hub for the development and testing of innovative maritime technologies. With over 20 research staff and postgraduate students already on board, the FSSD Lab is envisioned as a collaborative platform where industry partners, researchers, and students converge to co-develop technologies that will shape the design and operations of the next generation of harbour craft.\nA/Prof Tay shared updates on the FSSD programme at the FSSD Lab Industry Partner Day on 21 March 2025. (Photo: SIT)\nThe lab is equipped with industry-standard research equipment, including two advanced test rigs donated by global aerospace leader Rolls-Royce. These test rigs will help simulate real-life ship operations to aid research efforts, thereby enhancing research efforts and providing practical learning experiences.\nOne of them is a microgrid simulator that will simulate real-world charging conditions using renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. This allows researchers to test and optimise onshore Energy Management Systems (EMS) that coordinate energy flow between batteries, solar panels, the national grid, and shore chargers – essential for lowering charging costs and improving availability for electric harbour craft.\nThe Microgrid Simulator (right, against the wall) at the FSSD Laboratory replicates an onshore energy ecosystem, integrating renewable sources, battery storage, and grid supply. The screens (left) show the OASIS platform, which is used to simulate and test autonomous ship navigation and onboard systems in a virtual environment. (Photo: SIT)\nAnother is a System Health Management and Equipment Health Monitoring test rig, which simulates a shipboard electrical propulsion system. Its flexible and modular design allows it to represent fully electric and hybrid-electric configurations, with the added capability to simulate equipment faults and wear-and-tear. This enables the development of intelligent fault detection systems and predictive maintenance strategies, which are key to improving electric vessels’ safety, efficiency and uptime.\nWhat sets the FSSD Lab apart is its dual focus on research and applied learning. SIT undergraduates and adult learners will gain direct exposure to the same systems used by professionals in the field, bridging the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world maritime application. Through this immersive experience, students not only learn to use advanced technologies but also contribute meaningfully to solving key industry challenges.\nAll Hands On Deck\nWhile R&D can help speed up the development of technology and equipment to green the maritime industry, real progress hinges on strong collaboration in the maritime ecosystem. The challenges of decarbonising the sector – from cost pressures to technical complexity – require not just innovation in the lab, but practical input from those working at sea, shipyards, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), system integrators, classification societies and financial institutions.\nTo bridge this gap, SIT actively engages maritime partners such as local electric vessel maker Pyxis for their professional expertise. The learning goes both ways, with Pyxis tapping on SIT’s deep research capabilities in areas such as vessel electrification, efficiency optimisation, and smart energy management. In return, SIT students and faculty gain valuable exposure to the operational realities and challenges of deploying electric harbour craft in Singapore’s busy port ecosystem. Pyxis and SIT are also working together to develop future maritime professionals through SIT’s Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) – an eight- to 12-month-long internship that gives students exposure to industry outside of the classroom.\nForeground: A/Prof Tay (left) with Pyxis founder Mr Tommy Phun (right) at FSSD Lab Industry Partner Day on 21 March. (Photo: SIT)\n“Through the many collaborations, we have had the opportunity to work with talented SIT individuals who bring fresh perspectives, technical knowledge, and a hands-on approach to problem-solving,” said Pyxis founder Mr Tommy Phun.\nSuch collaborations are critical to tackling real-world industry challenges, acknowledged A/Prof Tay. “We must work closely with the industry to find practical and cost-effective solutions towards our net-zero goals,” he said.\nMr Phun agreed, “As the maritime industry continues to evolve, we believe that sustained collaboration with forward-thinking academic institutions like SIT will be key to driving impactful change in maritime sustainability.”\nSIT’s engagement with the maritime industry remains strong, with plans for a new research lab with Seatrium, a premier global marine and offshore solutions provider. Known as the Offshore & Marine Digital Learning Lab, it will drive the efficiency, sustainability and innovation of yard operations, energy microgrids and remote collaborations through artificial intelligence,\ndata analytics, and simulation models. Like the FSSD Lab, it will also offer immersive, hands-on learning for SIT students.\n“Decarbonising the carbon sector to electrification is a complex and difficult undertaking, but by working together, we can make this a reality,” said A/Prof Tay.\n[1]\nhttps://www.mpa.gov.sg/media-centre/details/11-proposals-selected-to-advance-electric-harbour-craft-designs-in-singapore\n[2]\nAs of 31 Mar 2025\nTopics\nMaritime\nMarine\nEngineering\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nApplied Research & Innovation\nIndustry & Community\nEngineering\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nA First-of-Its-Kind Toolkit For The Visually Impaired To Navigate The Digital World\nview\nNext\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n08 Apr 2025\nBridging the Gap Between Theory and Industry\nGloria Kwek, a final-year Electrical Power Engineering student at SIT, began her IWSP journey with the mindset of an intern but emerged feeling like a valued and integral member of the team.\ntag\nEducation"
