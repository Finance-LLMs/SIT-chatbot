    "The need for a sustainable and equitable food system has never been more pressing. Every year, nearly",
    "one-fifth",
    "of the world’s food goes to waste, further exacerbated by climate change and environmental degradation.",
    "At the recent International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFost) World Congress held in Rimini, Italy, in September, two alumni teams from the SIT-Massey University Food Technology degree programme showcased innovative approaches to sustainable food production and ethical consumption on this global stage. Their projects highlighted not only creativity but also a commitment to addressing critical issues in the food industry.",
    "Building Blocks of Food Sustainability and Ethical Consumption",
    "Alumni from the Bachelor of Food Technology degree programme showcased innovative approaches to sustainable food production and ethical consumption on this global stage. From left: Ng Wan Yu (Team Sea-no-meat), Darren Ten (Team Stalkative), Chia Yin Yin (Team Stalkative), A/Prof Du Juan, Nur Ifaaf (Team Sea-no-meat) (Photo: Chia Yin Yin).",
    "Team Stalkative, who was awarded 1st Runner-Up for Best Sustainability Concept, shared insights into their project,",
    "Snackikale",
    "– a lightly deep-fried seaweed-flavoured kale chip made from discarded kale stalks.The team collaborated with urban farming company",
    "Sustenir",
    "to tackle food waste. They re-purposed approximately 3,600 kilogrammes of unsold kale stalks – discarded annually by Sustenir’s indoor vertical farm – into a moreish but nutritious snack through valorisation – the transformation of waste into valuable resources. This solution helped the homegrown company minimise food waste while creating new revenue streams.",
    "Snackikale",
    "exemplifies the potential of upcycling in food production, demonstrating that sustainable practices can be both commercially viable and environmentally responsible. By minimising waste and embracing by-products, this innovative product encourages thoughtful and ethical consumption, paving the way for a more responsible food industry.",
    "Chia Yin Yin, an alumnus from the Food Technology degree programme, remarked, “SIT’s inter-disciplinary and immersive pedagogical approach transformed our development of",
    "Snackikale",
    ", allowing us to reimagine discarded kale stalks as a delicious and nutritious snack.”",
    "Team Sea-No-Meat's food innovation focused on addressing overfishing and microplastic contamination in seafood. From left: Esther Ong Su Xin, Tor Shi Qi, Bryan Tan Yi, Ngee Ee Lin, Ng Wanyu, Nur Ifaaf Ismail from Sea-No-Meat. (SIT Photo: RS Photography/Mark)",
    "Another notable contribution from SIT came from team",
    "Sea-no-meat",
    ", which aimed to tackle the dual challenges of overfishing and microplastic contamination in seafood. In partnership with Roquette, a leader in plant-based ingredients, the team developed Cumil, a bite-sized, plant-based squid snack designed as an alternative to traditional seafood products.",
    "Nurturing the Next Generation of Conscious Innovators",
    "Integral to the teams’ success was the mentorship of SIT and Massey University faculty members, who guided students in their projects.",
    "A/Prof Jorry Dharmawan",
    ", module co-coordinator, emphasised the importance of applying practical, real-world skills in a competitive and industry-relevant environment.",
    "“At SIT, we don’t just impart technical skills. We cultivate a mindset for creative problem-solving,” said A/Prof Dharmawan. “The team’s success highlights their ability to transform theoretical concepts into impactful solutions, having navigated the entire product development cycle, from concept to commercialisation.”",
    "As a university of applied learning, SIT’s pedagogy closely aligns with industry practices. Students are challenged to develop innovative solutions through a systematic and team-based approach. This hands-on exposure sharpens their critical thinking, technical expertise, and commercial acumen, ensuring they are equipped to tackle real-world challenges upon graduation.",
    "This real-world applied approach extends to research. Beyond student contributions, SIT’s presence at the Congress extended to faculty and research engineers presenting cutting-edge research.",
    "A/Prof Du Juan",
    "discussed her work on \"",
    "Assessing the Carbon Footprint of Brown Rice Protein-Based Fish Cake Analogue Using Life Cycle Assessment",

Every year, nearly\none-fifth\nof the world’s food goes to waste, further exacerbated by climate change and environmental degradation.\nAt the recent International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFost) World Congress held in Rimini, Italy, in September, two alumni teams from the SIT-Massey University Food Technology degree programme showcased innovative approaches to sustainable food production and ethical consumption on this global stage. Their projects highlighted not only creativity but also a commitment to addressing critical issues in the food industry.\nBuilding Blocks of Food Sustainability and Ethical Consumption\nAlumni from the Bachelor of Food Technology degree programme showcased innovative approaches to sustainable food production and ethical consumption on this global stage. From left: Ng Wan Yu (Team Sea-no-meat), Darren Ten (Team Stalkative), Chia Yin Yin (Team Stalkative), A/Prof Du Juan, Nur Ifaaf (Team Sea-no-meat) (Photo: Chia Yin Yin).\nTeam Stalkative, who was awarded 1st Runner-Up for Best Sustainability Concept, shared insights into their project,\nSnackikale\n– a lightly deep-fried seaweed-flavoured kale chip made from discarded kale stalks.The team collaborated with urban farming company\nSustenir\nto tackle food waste. They re-purposed approximately 3,600 kilogrammes of unsold kale stalks – discarded annually by Sustenir’s indoor vertical farm – into a moreish but nutritious snack through valorisation – the transformation of waste into valuable resources. This solution helped the homegrown company minimise food waste while creating new revenue streams.\nSnackikale\nexemplifies the potential of upcycling in food production, demonstrating that sustainable practices can be both commercially viable and environmentally responsible. By minimising waste and embracing by-products, this innovative product encourages thoughtful and ethical consumption, paving the way for a more responsible food industry.\nChia Yin Yin, an alumnus from the Food Technology degree programme, remarked, “SIT’s inter-disciplinary and immersive pedagogical approach transformed our development of\nSnackikale\n, allowing us to reimagine discarded kale stalks as a delicious and nutritious snack.”\nTeam Sea-No-Meat's food innovation focused on addressing overfishing and microplastic contamination in seafood.

(SIT Photo: RS Photography/Mark)\nAnother notable contribution from SIT came from team\nSea-no-meat\n, which aimed to tackle the dual challenges of overfishing and microplastic contamination in seafood. In partnership with Roquette, a leader in plant-based ingredients, the team developed Cumil, a bite-sized, plant-based squid snack designed as an alternative to traditional seafood products.\nNurturing the Next Generation of Conscious Innovators\nIntegral to the teams’ success was the mentorship of SIT and Massey University faculty members, who guided students in their projects.\nA/Prof Jorry Dharmawan\n, module co-coordinator, emphasised the importance of applying practical, real-world skills in a competitive and industry-relevant environment.\n“At SIT, we don’t just impart technical skills. We cultivate a mindset for creative problem-solving,” said A/Prof Dharmawan. “The team’s success highlights their ability to transform theoretical concepts into impactful solutions, having navigated the entire product development cycle, from concept to commercialisation.”\nAs a university of applied learning, SIT’s pedagogy closely aligns with industry practices. Students are challenged to develop innovative solutions through a systematic and team-based approach. This hands-on exposure sharpens their critical thinking, technical expertise, and commercial acumen, ensuring they are equipped to tackle real-world challenges upon graduation.\nThis real-world applied approach extends to research. Beyond student contributions, SIT’s presence at the Congress extended to faculty and research engineers presenting cutting-edge research.\nA/Prof Du Juan\ndiscussed her work on \"\nAssessing the Carbon Footprint of Brown Rice Protein-Based Fish Cake Analogue Using Life Cycle Assessment\n,\" while Research Engineer Cheryl Ng presented her research on \"\nThe Effects of Hydrocolloids on the Structure, Physical Properties, and Lipid Digestion of Non-Dairy Whipped Cream.\n\"\nA/Prof Du Juan and Research Engineer Cheryl Ng showcased impactful research at the Congress (Photo: Cheryl Ng)\nLooking Ahead: Driving Sustainable Solutions in Food Science\nWith the food industry facing significant challenges, the combination of technology, sustainability, and education is essential for building a resilient food ecosystem. Yin Yin  puts it best -\n“It is important to empower both producers and consumers to adopt practices that prioritise environmental health, social responsibility, and nutritional well-being.”  She believes that the future of sustainable and ethical products depends on cultivating a culture of innovation and collaboration.\nTopics\nFood Technology\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nApplied Research & Innovation\nFood, Chemical and Biotechnology\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nBridging Innovation and Care: From Adaptive Chairs to Storytelling Tools for Inclusive Learning\nview\nNext\nElevating Food Industry Standards Through Transnational Partnerships\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
