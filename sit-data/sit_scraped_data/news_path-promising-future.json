    "On the Path to a Promising Future",
    "Having overcome initial challenges in her educational journey, Iliona Teo Rui Qi is charting a course toward a promising future as she enhances her personal and professional development at the Singapore Institute of Technology.",
    "Iliona Teo Rui Qi is pursuing a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Digital Communications and Integrated Media at SIT. She is a recipient of the SIT Scholarship. (Photo: Bright Sparks)",
    "The road to success is seldom straight, often marked by unexpected twists, turns, and detours. Yet, what truly defines success is the ability to overcome obstacles and emerge victorious. Iliona Teo Rui Qi’s journey to success is a testament to this.",
    "Reflecting on her educational journey, she shares her experience of feeling adrift during her days at the Institute of Technical Education. “I found myself without a clear direction or purpose and struggled to envision a path forward,” she shared. “The feeling of being perceived as the ‘bottom’ of the educational system made me doubt my abilities to progress, not to mention making it to a university.”",
    "Despite feeling disheartened, Iliona refused to be derailed by disappointment. Instead, she seized every opportunity to cultivate new skills and explore her interests. It was during this period of resilience that she discovered her passion for design and media, dedicating herself to enhancing her portfolio. She then pursued a Diploma in Communication Design at Temasek Polytechnic.",
    "“Looking back, it was such a crucial point in my journey. It taught me resilience and determination to always put up a good fight to accomplish my goals,” she reflected. “If it weren’t for having a positive mindset, I would not have been able to overcome these challenges and make it to where I am today.”",
    "After completing her diploma in 2022, Iliona pursued her degree studies and was awarded the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) Scholarship.",
    "“The SIT Scholarship was certainly a milestone in my personal journey. “It meant more than just financial support; It represented a wholehearted opportunity for academic excellence and personal growth,” she reminisced.",
    "A Transformative Journey",
    "Iliona’s journey at SIT has been nothing short of transformative. Currently pursuing a degree in Digital Communications and Integrated Media (DCIM), she views this as a perfect fusion of her passion for creativity and innovation.",
    "“This programme not only promises a platform to hone my creativity but also offers unlimited opportunities to delve deeper into using sophisticated digital tools and techniques,” she explained.",
    "The three-year curriculum is diverse, offering avenues for inquiry and skill development, as well as the flexibility to dive into multiple fields while laying the groundwork for numerous career paths.",
    "“I look forward to expanding my knowledge across a range of skills and applying them to the eight-month Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) to gain working experience and networking opportunities,” Iliona added.",
    "At SIT, Iliona’s education is not confined to the classroom. With a methodology that seamlessly integrates academic knowledge and skills with real-world applications, SIT fosters an environment where theory meets practice.",
    "“For example, one of our professors arranged for us to visit Publicis Groupe, one of the leading communications organisations, allowing us to build connections with experienced industry experts,” she said. “What interests me most is the prospect of modules taught in SIT that provide intriguing learning techniques and projects that replicate real-world settings, giving us meaningful exposure to professional practices.”",
    "In addition to excelling in academics, Iliona also shines in Ultimate Frisbee.",
    "Her team’s recent achievements of securing the top three positions in the Singapore University Games and the Institute-Varsity-Polytechnic tournament attest to her dedication and skill. She also represented Singapore in the Ultimate Frisbee World-Under 24 Tournament in 2023, where her team clinched a historic silver medal!",
    "While balancing her academic commitments and co-curricular activities, Iliona appreciates SIT’s trimester-based academic structure.",
    "“I find the trimester structure refreshing even with the fast pace of the curriculum and shorter breaks,” she said. “It provides a remarkable opportunity for me to engage in continuous learning and skill development at an accelerated pace. Soon, my three years of education will come to an end. With this in mind, I am dedicated to making the most of my time at SIT to gain useful knowledge and skills that will prepare me for the challenges of the workplace!”",
    "Iliona Teo Rui Qi (Photo: Bright Sparks)",
    "Focusing on the Future",
    "“In the past, I had doubts about my ability to excel,” she confessed. “But over the years, I have embarked on a transformational journey, actively developed my leadership skills, and honed my personal growth,” she said.",
    "“I am grateful for SIT’s trust in me, and I look forward to pushing the boundaries and continuing to learn and grow.”",
    "Highlighting opportunities for aspiring SIT Scholars, Iliona shares insights into specially curated activities like the Scholars’ Camp, offering workshops and activities for personal development. “For instance, we had an in-depth individual profile analysis to learn more about our behavioural strengths and motivations. We then utilise these insights to develop stronger ties and relationships with others,” she added.",
    "With her eyes set on the future, Iliona is embracing the opportunities that await within SIT and beyond.",

She is a recipient of the SIT Scholarship. (Photo: Bright Sparks)\nThe road to success is seldom straight, often marked by unexpected twists, turns, and detours. Yet, what truly defines success is the ability to overcome obstacles and emerge victorious. Iliona Teo Rui Qi’s journey to success is a testament to this.\nReflecting on her educational journey, she shares her experience of feeling adrift during her days at the Institute of Technical Education. “I found myself without a clear direction or purpose and struggled to envision a path forward,” she shared. “The feeling of being perceived as the ‘bottom’ of the educational system made me doubt my abilities to progress, not to mention making it to a university.”\nDespite feeling disheartened, Iliona refused to be derailed by disappointment. Instead, she seized every opportunity to cultivate new skills and explore her interests. It was during this period of resilience that she discovered her passion for design and media, dedicating herself to enhancing her portfolio. She then pursued a Diploma in Communication Design at Temasek Polytechnic.\n“Looking back, it was such a crucial point in my journey. It taught me resilience and determination to always put up a good fight to accomplish my goals,” she reflected. “If it weren’t for having a positive mindset, I would not have been able to overcome these challenges and make it to where I am today.”\nAfter completing her diploma in 2022, Iliona pursued her degree studies and was awarded the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) Scholarship.\n“The SIT Scholarship was certainly a milestone in my personal journey. “It meant more than just financial support; It represented a wholehearted opportunity for academic excellence and personal growth,” she reminisced.\nA Transformative Journey\nIliona’s journey at SIT has been nothing short of transformative. Currently pursuing a degree in Digital Communications and Integrated Media (DCIM), she views this as a perfect fusion of her passion for creativity and innovation.\n“This programme not only promises a platform to hone my creativity but also offers unlimited opportunities to delve deeper into using sophisticated digital tools and techniques,” she explained.\nThe three-year curriculum is diverse, offering avenues for inquiry and skill development, as well as the flexibility to dive into multiple fields while laying the groundwork for numerous career paths.\n“I look forward to expanding my knowledge across a range of skills and applying them to the eight-month Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) to gain working experience and networking opportunities,” Iliona added.\nAt SIT, Iliona’s education is not confined to the classroom. With a methodology that seamlessly integrates academic knowledge and skills with real-world applications, SIT fosters an environment where theory meets practice.\n“For example, one of our professors arranged for us to visit Publicis Groupe, one of the leading communications organisations, allowing us to build connections with experienced industry experts,” she said. “What interests me most is the prospect of modules taught in SIT that provide intriguing learning techniques and projects that replicate real-world settings, giving us meaningful exposure to professional practices.”\nIn addition to excelling in academics, Iliona also shines in Ultimate Frisbee.\nHer team’s recent achievements of securing the top three positions in the Singapore University Games and the Institute-Varsity-Polytechnic tournament attest to her dedication and skill. She also represented Singapore in the Ultimate Frisbee World-Under 24 Tournament in 2023, where her team clinched a historic silver medal!\nWhile balancing her academic commitments and co-curricular activities, Iliona appreciates SIT’s trimester-based academic structure.\n“I find the trimester structure refreshing even with the fast pace of the curriculum and shorter breaks,” she said. “It provides a remarkable opportunity for me to engage in continuous learning and skill development at an accelerated pace. Soon, my three years of education will come to an end. With this in mind, I am dedicated to making the most of my time at SIT to gain useful knowledge and skills that will prepare me for the challenges of the workplace!”\nIliona Teo Rui Qi (Photo: Bright Sparks)\nFocusing on the Future\n“In the past, I had doubts about my ability to excel,” she confessed. “But over the years, I have embarked on a transformational journey, actively developed my leadership skills, and honed my personal growth,” she said.\n“I am grateful for SIT’s trust in me, and I look forward to pushing the boundaries and continuing to learn and grow.”\nHighlighting opportunities for aspiring SIT Scholars, Iliona shares insights into specially curated activities like the Scholars’ Camp, offering workshops and activities for personal development. “For instance, we had an in-depth individual profile analysis to learn more about our behavioural strengths and motivations. We then utilise these insights to develop stronger ties and relationships with others,” she added.\nWith her eyes set on the future, Iliona is embracing the opportunities that await within SIT and beyond.\nThis article first appeared on\nBrightSparks\n.\nTopics\nCommunication and Design\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nBusiness, Communication and Design\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nCreating Inclusive Futures\nview\nNext\nUpward Trend in Salaries and Healthy Employment Outcomes Mark SIT’s Decade of Impact\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
