    "Delivering quality education as Covid-19 continues",
    "As the mid-trimester break rolled around, academic staff at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) were busier than ever. The clock was ticking — they had just 10 days to move their curriculum online.",
    "As Singapore tightened safe distancing measures to minimise the spread of Covid-19, educational institutions were forced to conduct classes remotely. How did SIT, a university which heavily emphasises applied learning, adapt to deliver quality education to students under these conditions?",
    "GovInsider catches up with Professor Chua Kee Chaing, Deputy President (Academic) & Provost, SIT, to find out more.",
    "All hands on deck to prepare for e-learning",
    "SIT first made the decision to bring their classes online in April at the start of Singapore’s Circuit Breaker, just as the mid-trimester break began.",
    "The university immediately stepped in to ease lecturers’ transition to online teaching. “Prior to campus closure, SIT created and launched various types of training for faculty members to provide online learning,” comments Prof Chua. These workshops included guides on running effective live-streaming classes, designing alternative assessments, and creating narrated slides.",
    "Such measures helped faculty members feel more comfortable with online lesson delivery methods. These enabled them to hit the ground running with lessons as the trimester resumed, minimising disruptions to students’ learning.",
    "SIT also recognised that assessment methods would have to be altered. In administering online exams, a fine balance had to be struck between reducing potential dishonesty during examinations, while still accurately evaluating students’ learning.",
    "“We had to appeal to our faculty members to set exams that are short, so that we minimised problems related to online proctoring of the exams,” says Prof Chua. Yet, the tests had to be effective to allow SIT to test students’ learning in a reasonable manner.",
    "In lieu of physical invigilators, SIT incorporated technology such as lockdown browsers — software that prevents computers from accessing other websites while an exam is running — to facilitate testing. The university also required students to turn on web cameras during their exams. Using artificial intelligence algorithms to detect instances in which students behaved suspiciously on-camera, invigilators were then able to flag instances of inappropriate conduct and reached out to students, if necessary.",
    "Support for the community",
    "Beyond ensuring the technical viability of online classes, SIT also took steps to ensure that all students had equal access to quality learning, unhindered by financial obstruction or unconducive learning environments.",
    "“When we went online, some of our students had no technical support,” explains Prof Chua. Some students lacked Wi-Fi broadband services, while others did not have access to computers.",
    "SIT’s Student Life Division and several staff members stepped in immediately, delivering devices to affected students. The university also set up the Student Relief Fund at SIT (COVID-19) to assist undergraduates facing unexpected financial hardship due to the outbreak. With more than $800,000 in donations to date, grants from the Fund go towards students’ daily living expenses, tuition fees, laptop costs and more.",
    "Challenges still lie ahead",
    "Despite the university’s best efforts, some aspects of face-to-face education cannot be readily substituted with an online environment.",
    "“We are very much an applied learning university,” comments Prof Chua. “A lot of hands-on interactions, a lot of project work, a lot of interaction with companies. So the challenge of bringing all those on to an online platform is really huge, and we may not be able to bring all of that online.”",
    "Most notably, SIT’s flagship Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) has taken a hit. The programme requires students to undertake six to 12 months of relevant work attachments during the course of their studies, and some attachments had to be put on hold due to the pandemic. The university is discussing with employers about how to pivot and provide new programmes.",
    "The pandemic’s disruptions are felt most acutely by the graduating Class of 2020, many of whom experienced the double whammy of disrupted attachments and an unfriendly job market. To combat this, SIT is providing the cohort with further learning opportunities to boost their employability.",
    "SIT is taking part in the SGUnited Traineeships Programme, an initiative spearheaded by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Workforce Singapore (WSG). The programme aims to provide up to 21,000 paid 12-month traineeship opportunities for fresh graduates.",
    "Traineeship positions are available across SIT’s corporate and academic divisions, ranging from project engineers and research assistants, to cybersecurity trainees and project officers. These traineeships, the university hopes, will go a long way in helping graduates develop industry-relevant skills and build professional networks.",
    "The university is also offering the graduating cohort free access to over 190 Continuing Education Training (CET) modules at SITLEARN Professional Development, the lifelong learning division of SIT. The modules span a wide variety of topics, from management training to machine learning. These offer fresh graduates an opportunity to upskill while the economy recovers.",
    "Looking forward: “Don’t waste the crisis”",
    "Prof Chua encourages educators to take advantage of these uncertain times, to look towards the future of educational pedagogy.",
    "“Don’t waste the crisis,” he urges his colleagues. “One of the good things that came out of this [pandemic] is really to get us to think even post Covid-19. The crisis allows us to take a step back and assess how we can improve in our lesson delivery.”",
    "“You could get students to look at online materials, then bring them [into class] for a face-to-face discussion. The ‘flipped-classroom’ method of delivery could lead to a lot of enhancement in student learning.”",
    "Contingency plans against similar situations in the future would also require tech-forward solutions.",
    "“How do we make better use of technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality to do some of this more practical work? We already have some of these technologies in place for some of our modules, but can we deploy them for other lessons as well? These will be some of the things that we are thinking through,” adds Prof Chua.",
    "These are challenging times for educators and students alike. But with flexibility, resilience and care for the community, SIT intends to ride the waves of disruption.",

The clock was ticking — they had just 10 days to move their curriculum online.\nAs Singapore tightened safe distancing measures to minimise the spread of Covid-19, educational institutions were forced to conduct classes remotely. How did SIT, a university which heavily emphasises applied learning, adapt to deliver quality education to students under these conditions?\nGovInsider catches up with Professor Chua Kee Chaing, Deputy President (Academic) & Provost, SIT, to find out more.\nAll hands on deck to prepare for e-learning\nSIT first made the decision to bring their classes online in April at the start of Singapore’s Circuit Breaker, just as the mid-trimester break began.\nThe university immediately stepped in to ease lecturers’ transition to online teaching. “Prior to campus closure, SIT created and launched various types of training for faculty members to provide online learning,” comments Prof Chua. These workshops included guides on running effective live-streaming classes, designing alternative assessments, and creating narrated slides.\nSuch measures helped faculty members feel more comfortable with online lesson delivery methods. These enabled them to hit the ground running with lessons as the trimester resumed, minimising disruptions to students’ learning.\nSIT also recognised that assessment methods would have to be altered. In administering online exams, a fine balance had to be struck between reducing potential dishonesty during examinations, while still accurately evaluating students’ learning.\n“We had to appeal to our faculty members to set exams that are short, so that we minimised problems related to online proctoring of the exams,” says Prof Chua. Yet, the tests had to be effective to allow SIT to test students’ learning in a reasonable manner.\nIn lieu of physical invigilators, SIT incorporated technology such as lockdown browsers — software that prevents computers from accessing other websites while an exam is running — to facilitate testing. The university also required students to turn on web cameras during their exams. Using artificial intelligence algorithms to detect instances in which students behaved suspiciously on-camera, invigilators were then able to flag instances of inappropriate conduct and reached out to students, if necessary.\nSupport for the community\nBeyond ensuring the technical viability of online classes, SIT also took steps to ensure that all students had equal access to quality learning, unhindered by financial obstruction or unconducive learning environments.\n“When we went online, some of our students had no technical support,” explains Prof Chua. Some students lacked Wi-Fi broadband services, while others did not have access to computers.\nSIT’s Student Life Division and several staff members stepped in immediately, delivering devices to affected students. The university also set up the Student Relief Fund at SIT (COVID-19) to assist undergraduates facing unexpected financial hardship due to the outbreak. With more than $800,000 in donations to date, grants from the Fund go towards students’ daily living expenses, tuition fees, laptop costs and more.\nChallenges still lie ahead\nDespite the university’s best efforts, some aspects of face-to-face education cannot be readily substituted with an online environment.\n“We are very much an applied learning university,” comments Prof Chua. “A lot of hands-on interactions, a lot of project work, a lot of interaction with companies. So the challenge of bringing all those on to an online platform is really huge, and we may not be able to bring all of that online.”\nMost notably, SIT’s flagship Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) has taken a hit. The programme requires students to undertake six to 12 months of relevant work attachments during the course of their studies, and some attachments had to be put on hold due to the pandemic. The university is discussing with employers about how to pivot and provide new programmes.\nThe pandemic’s disruptions are felt most acutely by the graduating Class of 2020, many of whom experienced the double whammy of disrupted attachments and an unfriendly job market. To combat this, SIT is providing the cohort with further learning opportunities to boost their employability.\nSIT is taking part in the SGUnited Traineeships Programme, an initiative spearheaded by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Workforce Singapore (WSG). The programme aims to provide up to 21,000 paid 12-month traineeship opportunities for fresh graduates.\nTraineeship positions are available across SIT’s corporate and academic divisions, ranging from project engineers and research assistants, to cybersecurity trainees and project officers. These traineeships, the university hopes, will go a long way in helping graduates develop industry-relevant skills and build professional networks.\nThe university is also offering the graduating cohort free access to over 190 Continuing Education Training (CET) modules at SITLEARN Professional Development, the lifelong learning division of SIT. The modules span a wide variety of topics, from management training to machine learning. These offer fresh graduates an opportunity to upskill while the economy recovers.\nLooking forward: “Don’t waste the crisis”\nProf Chua encourages educators to take advantage of these uncertain times, to look towards the future of educational pedagogy.\n“Don’t waste the crisis,” he urges his colleagues. “One of the good things that came out of this [pandemic] is really to get us to think even post Covid-19. The crisis allows us to take a step back and assess how we can improve in our lesson delivery.”\n“You could get students to look at online materials, then bring them [into class] for a face-to-face discussion. The ‘flipped-classroom’ method of delivery could lead to a lot of enhancement in student learning.”\nContingency plans against similar situations in the future would also require tech-forward solutions.\n“How do we make better use of technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality to do some of this more practical work? We already have some of these technologies in place for some of our modules, but can we deploy them for other lessons as well? These will be some of the things that we are thinking through,” adds Prof Chua.\nThese are challenging times for educators and students alike. But with flexibility, resilience and care for the community, SIT intends to ride the waves of disruption.\nThis article was first published in\nGovInsider\n. Top picture credit: GovInsider.\nTopics\nFeatures\nCampus\nCOVID-19\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\n5 Careers For The Aspiring Media Professional\nview\nNext\nRecognising the Best of our Faculty – SIT Teaching Excellence Award AY2018/2019\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
