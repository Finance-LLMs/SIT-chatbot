    "Luminaries in the Making",
    "SIT graduates are finding that doors are swinging open along their chosen career paths, thanks to the Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).",
    "Taking eight to 12 months from a course of study to experience the working world wouldn’t necessarily pique the interest of many undergraduates. But two individuals from the Class of 2022 –",
    "Chew En Yu",
    "from the",
    "Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering",
    "programme, and",
    "Ravichandran Pradeep Kumar",
    "from the",
    "Mechanical Engineering",
    "programme – have a different tale to tell altogether.",
    "Ravichandran Pradeep Kumar (left) and Chew En Yu (right) secured employment at LionsBot and Dyson, the companies they were attached to for IWSP, respectively. (SIT Photos: Keng Photography/Gwen Chew, Wang Zhixiang)",
    "While En Yu and Pradeep were both prepared to undertake SIT’s signature Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) as part of their degree programmes last year, they readily admitted it was not something they were looking forward to. But they know that IWSP is not a typical internship.",
    "So Much More",
    "SIT has developed IWSP as a distinctive feature of its degree programmes, moulding not just industry-ready graduates but also a talent pipeline for employers. It is part of what SIT calls ‘green harvesting’ – where it forges close ties with industry partners to provide meaningful work attachments for students. The end result is efficacious; students get to integrate theory and practice and develop deeper skills in their chosen fields.",
    "There is a good reason why SIT uses the term ‘work attachment’ and not ‘internship’ in describing IWSP. En Yu relates how his preconception of IWSP swiftly changed once he started; no menial jobs, he asserted, just real work, with real impact on real products. “There was so much more to IWSP than I had thought, from the scope of work to the opportunities to apply my technical knowledge,” he said. “It exceeded all my expectations.”",
    "An Authentic Experience",
    "From start to end, IWSP immerses students in true-to-life scenarios, beginning with the job search and securing the attachment. There are no direct job placements through the university — students go through the same recruitment process one will find in the workforce and are assessed on their merits.",
    "Pradeep and his parents at his graduation. (SIT Photos: Keng Photography/Gwen Chew)",
    "Browsing SIT’s job portal, Pradeep submitted his application to robotics company LionsBot and earned a place for his IWSP. Meanwhile, En Yu took it as a personal challenge to apply for one of the most competitive jobs — at Dyson — and succeeded. Both were ecstatic to find an attachment that matched their interests. Importantly, they were also assured that these roles, curated by both the company and SIT, met specific needs in the industry and that the work attachment would pave the way to future opportunities.",
    "En Yu and Pradeep noted that they were well-prepared for the postings. Pradeep shared, “Many of the projects I had done at SIT were not small; they were very hands-on too. Hence, during IWSP, I could apply the same approaches to solving problems.” En Yu added that the curriculum taught by the university was very applicable, while other skills imparted also came in particularly useful, such as taking meeting minutes and journalling. His communications skills got a boost too, as he got to make presentations to management and other stakeholders.",
    "Thriving In the Workplace",
    "At the same time, the work attachment helped them to understand industry challenges better and develop the competence to meet them. Adaptability, creativity and innovation became innate qualities.",
    "Pradeep said he brought the SIT-ingrained ‘growth mindset’ to work with him, along with a positive attitude. “I also made it a point to talk to anyone and everyone,” he said, sharing that this helped build rapport with his colleagues, who would make time for him even during the busiest of periods. There would be days when work ended at 11pm, but he did not mind. Work was exciting and he got to exercise his creativity. “My input was always taken seriously by the company,” he disclosed. The best part, undoubtedly, was seeing the product he worked on hit the market. Were there challenges? “Honestly, I’ve forgotten, because I was having so much fun,” he said.",
    "Seamless Transition to Full-Time Job",
    "Only a handful of undergraduates secured attachments at Dyson for IWSP, and En Yu was one of them. (SIT Photos: Keng Photography/Wang Zhixiang)",
    "Asked if he soon thought of building his career at the company, En Yu emphatically said “Yes”. He was flexing his muscles in design engineering and getting the exposure to other aspects of manufacturing. He enjoyed the culture, the people, and the benefits. When he received positive feedback after his exit presentation to a room of Engineering leads and Engineering Managers, he had an inkling that his hopes would be fulfilled.",
    "As it turned out, his performance gave the Engineering Manager enough confidence in En Yu to hire him without a further interview. Today, the 26-year-old is working at Dyson as a Graduate Design Engineer, albeit in a different department.",
    "As for Pradeep, also 26, just seven months into the attachment, the Hardware Manager sounded him out in a chat and offered him time to think over a career at LionsBot. By then, Pradeep had grown an interest in both the hardware and autonomy aspects of the work, and felt he was able to contribute to both, while getting the chance to learn more. He has since accepted a job as Hardware Engineer at the company.",
    "Indeed, he is no less grateful to the IWSP. “It’s the best,” he enthused, and urged new SITizens to embrace it with open minds. “SIT truly has a lot to offer,” he asserted.",

But two individuals from the Class of 2022 –\nChew En Yu\nfrom the\nMechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering\nprogramme, and\nRavichandran Pradeep Kumar\nfrom the\nMechanical Engineering\nprogramme – have a different tale to tell altogether.\nRavichandran Pradeep Kumar (left) and Chew En Yu (right) secured employment at LionsBot and Dyson, the companies they were attached to for IWSP, respectively. (SIT Photos: Keng Photography/Gwen Chew, Wang Zhixiang)\nWhile En Yu and Pradeep were both prepared to undertake SIT’s signature Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) as part of their degree programmes last year, they readily admitted it was not something they were looking forward to. But they know that IWSP is not a typical internship.\nSo Much More\nSIT has developed IWSP as a distinctive feature of its degree programmes, moulding not just industry-ready graduates but also a talent pipeline for employers. It is part of what SIT calls ‘green harvesting’ – where it forges close ties with industry partners to provide meaningful work attachments for students. The end result is efficacious; students get to integrate theory and practice and develop deeper skills in their chosen fields.\nThere is a good reason why SIT uses the term ‘work attachment’ and not ‘internship’ in describing IWSP. En Yu relates how his preconception of IWSP swiftly changed once he started; no menial jobs, he asserted, just real work, with real impact on real products. “There was so much more to IWSP than I had thought, from the scope of work to the opportunities to apply my technical knowledge,” he said. “It exceeded all my expectations.”\nAn Authentic Experience\nFrom start to end, IWSP immerses students in true-to-life scenarios, beginning with the job search and securing the attachment. There are no direct job placements through the university — students go through the same recruitment process one will find in the workforce and are assessed on their merits.\nPradeep and his parents at his graduation. (SIT Photos: Keng Photography/Gwen Chew)\nBrowsing SIT’s job portal, Pradeep submitted his application to robotics company LionsBot and earned a place for his IWSP. Meanwhile, En Yu took it as a personal challenge to apply for one of the most competitive jobs — at Dyson — and succeeded. Both were ecstatic to find an attachment that matched their interests. Importantly, they were also assured that these roles, curated by both the company and SIT, met specific needs in the industry and that the work attachment would pave the way to future opportunities.\nEn Yu and Pradeep noted that they were well-prepared for the postings. Pradeep shared, “Many of the projects I had done at SIT were not small; they were very hands-on too. Hence, during IWSP, I could apply the same approaches to solving problems.” En Yu added that the curriculum taught by the university was very applicable, while other skills imparted also came in particularly useful, such as taking meeting minutes and journalling. His communications skills got a boost too, as he got to make presentations to management and other stakeholders.\nThriving In the Workplace\nAt the same time, the work attachment helped them to understand industry challenges better and develop the competence to meet them. Adaptability, creativity and innovation became innate qualities.\nPradeep said he brought the SIT-ingrained ‘growth mindset’ to work with him, along with a positive attitude. “I also made it a point to talk to anyone and everyone,” he said, sharing that this helped build rapport with his colleagues, who would make time for him even during the busiest of periods. There would be days when work ended at 11pm, but he did not mind. Work was exciting and he got to exercise his creativity. “My input was always taken seriously by the company,” he disclosed. The best part, undoubtedly, was seeing the product he worked on hit the market. Were there challenges? “Honestly, I’ve forgotten, because I was having so much fun,” he said.\nSeamless Transition to Full-Time Job\nOnly a handful of undergraduates secured attachments at Dyson for IWSP, and En Yu was one of them. (SIT Photos: Keng Photography/Wang Zhixiang)\nAsked if he soon thought of building his career at the company, En Yu emphatically said “Yes”. He was flexing his muscles in design engineering and getting the exposure to other aspects of manufacturing. He enjoyed the culture, the people, and the benefits. When he received positive feedback after his exit presentation to a room of Engineering leads and Engineering Managers, he had an inkling that his hopes would be fulfilled.\nAs it turned out, his performance gave the Engineering Manager enough confidence in En Yu to hire him without a further interview. Today, the 26-year-old is working at Dyson as a Graduate Design Engineer, albeit in a different department.\nAs for Pradeep, also 26, just seven months into the attachment, the Hardware Manager sounded him out in a chat and offered him time to think over a career at LionsBot. By then, Pradeep had grown an interest in both the hardware and autonomy aspects of the work, and felt he was able to contribute to both, while getting the chance to learn more. He has since accepted a job as Hardware Engineer at the company.\nIndeed, he is no less grateful to the IWSP. “It’s the best,” he enthused, and urged new SITizens to embrace it with open minds. “SIT truly has a lot to offer,” he asserted.\nTopics\nMechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering\nMechanical Engineering\nFeatures\nSuccess Stories\nGraduation\nIntegrated Work Study Programme\nGraduates\nIndustry Immersions\nCATEGORIES\nAcademic Clusters\nEngineering\nSITizens & Campus\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nPassion for Innovation Made Possible at SIT\nview\nNext\nThis is for Her\nview\nRelated News\n26 Mar 2025\nPower Through Emotion\nSIT, Chemistry and Pod of Life unveil a new approach to combat workplace burnout through The Emotional Baggage Board Game.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Academic Clusters, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n18 Sep 2024\nOCBC to Invest $500 Million in Punggol Digital District\nInvestment includes a multi-million-dollar strategic partnership with SIT\ntag\nPress Releases, Industry & Community, Academic Clusters, Business, Communication and Design, Infocomm Technology\n23 Jun 2023\nHelping Mental Health Patients Lead Meaningful Lives\nCognitive remediation expert A/Prof Tan Bhing Leet was recently awarded the 2023 Connie Lieber Science to Practice Award for Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry.\ntag\nAcademic Clusters, Health and Social Sciences"
