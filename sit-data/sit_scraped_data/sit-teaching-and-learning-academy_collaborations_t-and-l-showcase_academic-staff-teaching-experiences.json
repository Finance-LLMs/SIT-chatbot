    "“The most rewarding part of being an educator at SIT is learning alongside my students through teaching them. Their creative and often unpredictable questions help me think of problems from a different perspective.",
    "Here, we train our students to use theoretical principles in a practical manner. Often, my students’ interest in a topic is piqued when current news articles or real-life industrial examples are used to link back to the concepts they are learning in class.",
    "Hands-on laboratory classes with relevant content have also been used to enhance applied learning in our classes. Students get opportunities to apply the theoretical facts learnt during lectures to interpret data and formulate conclusions generated during laboratory classes. These exercises inadvertently help shape students’ critical thinking and analytical skills, which is one of my motivations for teaching.",
    "My hope is that students’ analytical and problem-solving skills developed while at SIT will be applied to their future jobs in the industry. While I realise that not all students will choose to stay in their field of study, the critical thinking skills developed through their studies will hopefully help them achieve many greater things in life.”",

One of the modules I co-created is a prime example of this applied learning approach, ICT’s Integrative Team Project. This requires a lot of coordination: from the structure of the module, timelines, assessments, rubrics, industry interaction, etc. There is also industry feedback taken into the marking process — to help provide an authentic assessment.
