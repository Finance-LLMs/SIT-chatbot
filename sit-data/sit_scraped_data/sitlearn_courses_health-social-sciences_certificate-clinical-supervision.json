    "Demands for advanced clinical supervision competency in Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) have escalated over the past decade.",
    "Multiple efforts such as the conversion of AHP Entry level training from a Diploma to 4 years of Bachelor study (Hon), the introduction of the Pre-Employment Clinical Training (PECT) fund, as well as the enaction of Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC) supervisory framework have increased the accountability of clinical departments to provide high-quality clinical training and assessment to AHP students and new graduates. Clinical supervisors and educators play key roles in assessing progress, facilitating learning, and supporting the well-being of learners at the workplace. It is therefore critical for clinical supervisors and educators to deliver cost-effective clinical training using evidence-based education practices.",
    "This Certificate in Clinical Supervision is designed to equip AHP clinical supervisors and educators with the intermediate-level competencies to provide effective clinical training to AHPs and students. It aims to support clinical supervisors and educators to learn, use, and reflect on the application of evidence-based education theories and skills in clinical supervision at the workplace. The programmatic approach also seeks to develop capability and confidence amongst senior AHP educators to support the culture of teaching and learning at their workplaces through coaching junior educators.",
    "This 4-month competency-based education programme is designed based on the “clinical teaching and supervision” and “reflective practice” competencies in the Skills map for senior AHPs under the Skills Framework for Healthcare. Learning activities will comprise e-learning, workshops, peer feedback, group coaching, and workplace application and reflection. Advanced competency will be established through multiple modes of assessment such as quizzes, short answer questions, OSTE (Objective Structured Teaching Exercise), workplace assessment, and video presentation.",

    "“I found the course on clinical supervision to be incredibly valuable. It not only provided a comprehensive understanding of the principles of clinical supervision but also emphasised the importance of utilising different models for supervision, including reflective practice, assessing the progress of learning, facilitating learning, and supporting well-being.\r\n\r\nThe content was well-structured, informative, and provided practical insights that have enhanced my skills as a clinical educator. I now feel more equipped to apply diverse supervision models effectively, which has improved my ability to support the well-being of both radiographers and students. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to enhance their supervisory abilities in a clinical setting.”",
    "Evelyn Chia",
    "Senior Occupational Therapist, NTUC First Campus",
    "“It has been inspiring and enriching for me. As a first-time clinical supervisor, I feel empowered and equipped, giving me more confidence as I embark on my first clinical supervisor experience.”",

    "“By attending the course, I was able to build on my knowledge and skills in clinical supervision. The assignments allowed me to find out whether I truly understand and know how to apply what I have learned.\r\n\r\nThe lecturers were very experienced, knowledgeable, and generous with sharing their knowledge at the same time. They challenged us to reflect on our current practices and ways by which we can improve our supervision skills.”",
