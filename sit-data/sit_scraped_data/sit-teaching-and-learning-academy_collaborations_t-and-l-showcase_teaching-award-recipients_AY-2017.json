She actively engages industry partners in giving talks, organizes field trips, and embeds real-life cases in her project assignments. Christina fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between her students and interior design students. She serves as a mentor to students, by encouraging them, providing career advice and connecting her students to industry players.",

    "Dr Lee Kwee Hiong",
    "Associate Professor Lee Kwee Hiong stands firm with the belief that the key in enhancing students' learning experience are continual engagement and motivation. He facilitates this through adoption of learning platforms such as Raspberry and Arduino programming boards, as well as emphasizing the 'process' leading up to the final solution, instead of just showing the final solution (in the example of software programming modules). These approaches have broken the monotony of lectures and most importantly built up the confidence in students to achieve much more.",

As such, he strives to embed application of theoretical knowledge on actual engineering applications through various approaches such as computer simulations, on-site field testing and interactive learning packages. He also strives to create a conducive learning environment to ensure every student will have a positive learning journey.",

He constantly strives to design and adopt teaching methodologies and practices to imbue these attributes in his students. These begin right from Week One with the constant emphasis in the importance of asking questions. He also strives to embed unique “industry lab session” to provide students with the opportunity to learn from real-world industry practices.\n(Abstract from citation by Eng Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Victor Wang\nAssistant Professor Victor Wang believes that the digital revolution of today coupled with the increased interconnectivity requires educators to learn new approaches that will have the ability to anticipate and predict new learning patterns to continually engage students. As such, he strives to embed application of theoretical knowledge on actual engineering applications through various approaches such as computer simulations, on-site field testing and interactive learning packages. He also strives to create a conducive learning environment to ensure every student will have a positive learning journey.\n(Abstract from citation by Eng Evaluation Committee Member)"
