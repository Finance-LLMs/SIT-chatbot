    "PenGwyn Adds Colour to Ramadan and Hari Raya",
    "In celebration of Ramadan and Hari Raya this year, Punggol West Constituency teamed up with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore (DigiPen (Singapore)) to launch a series of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) animations featuring",
    "PenGwyn",
    ", Punggol West Constituency’s lovable mascot. Depicting",
    "PenGwyn",
    "in various at-home family settings in light of the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker, the animated GIFs were created to celebrate the spirit of Ramadan and Hari Raya Aidilfitri with the Muslim community.",
    "The animated GIFs were designed by Pang Kai Lun, a DigiPen (Singapore) graduate from the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Art and Animation (BFA) programme. Both SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) worked closely with grassroots leaders of Punggol West Constituency to brainstorm the storyboards and assess ground sentiments regarding artistic styles with cultural sensitivities in mind. The collaborators were also mindful to portray accurate depictions considering the Circuit Breaker situation.",
    "The first GIF depicts PenGwyn joining in a family’s pre-dawn meal via video conferencing.",
    "The second animated GIF saw PenGwyn and friends virtually joining a family’s breaking of fast dinner.",
    "The final GIF saw PenGwyn wishing the Muslim community Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri.",
    "“I appreciate the refreshing and light-hearted greetings. Even though we are not able to physically convene for our usual communal Ramadan dinners and Hari Raya celebrations due to the Circuit Breaker, I am touched and encouraged by the community’s outreach through these heartwarming animations. Looking forward to hosting our friends when the situation gets better!” said Mr Haja Nizamudeen, a Punggol West resident.",
    "Ms Sun Xueling, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, and Member of Parliament for Punggol West Constituency, agreed that this year’s Ramadan and Hari Raya celebrations are like no other. “We may be far in distance but close at heart. This collaboration with SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) is our Punggol Community’s way to show that we have our Muslim residents in our hearts, and we want to send them our festive good wishes – no matter how physically far apart we are.",
    "PenGwyn",
    "represents a kind, generous and loving young child of Punggol. He enjoys going around the neighbourhood to wish our residents well, while learning more about them and caring for them. I am grateful to SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) for investing their creative and artistic talents in this collaboration, and I look forward to working together on more projects in the future,” she said.",
    "Kai Lun shared that the project has helped him gain a deeper understanding of different cultural practices and nuances, while allowing him to exercise his creative skills. “I cherish the insights and learning experiences gained. As we live in a multi-racial and multi-religious society, it’s important to ensure that",
    "PenGwyn",
    "is portrayed as sociable, friendly and inclusive. It’s been great to be part of the meaningful collaboration that SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) have with Punggol West Constituency,” shared Kai Lun, who is currently imparting his design and interactive media skills as a part-time educator.",
    "It is the second time such a project has been rolled out by SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) with Punggol West Constituency. As part of a year-long project consisting of collaterals and design work for various festivities, SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) had previously assisted in the creation of the",
    "PenGwyn",
    "mascot, as well as its launch at the Punggol West Spring Lantern Festival (Yuan Xiao Jie). Kai Lun, along with fellow DigiPen (Singapore) BFA alumnus Lee Wee Tat, had designed the mascot and worked on the",
    "community video",
    "for the festival.",
    "The mascot will continue to be featured in various collaterals for the Punggol West Constituency Office, with the most recent roll-out being a Sticker Pack specially made for this COVID-19 situation. Each sticker features a reminder on hygiene and safe distancing measures. The Sticker Packs for Android and iOS users are available for download here:",

Depicting\nPenGwyn\nin various at-home family settings in light of the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker, the animated GIFs were created to celebrate the spirit of Ramadan and Hari Raya Aidilfitri with the Muslim community.\nThe animated GIFs were designed by Pang Kai Lun, a DigiPen (Singapore) graduate from the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Art and Animation (BFA) programme. Both SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) worked closely with grassroots leaders of Punggol West Constituency to brainstorm the storyboards and assess ground sentiments regarding artistic styles with cultural sensitivities in mind. The collaborators were also mindful to portray accurate depictions considering the Circuit Breaker situation.\nThe first GIF depicts PenGwyn joining in a family’s pre-dawn meal via video conferencing.\nThe second animated GIF saw PenGwyn and friends virtually joining a family’s breaking of fast dinner.\nThe final GIF saw PenGwyn wishing the Muslim community Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri.\n“I appreciate the refreshing and light-hearted greetings. Even though we are not able to physically convene for our usual communal Ramadan dinners and Hari Raya celebrations due to the Circuit Breaker, I am touched and encouraged by the community’s outreach through these heartwarming animations. Looking forward to hosting our friends when the situation gets better!” said Mr Haja Nizamudeen, a Punggol West resident.\nMs Sun Xueling, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, and Member of Parliament for Punggol West Constituency, agreed that this year’s Ramadan and Hari Raya celebrations are like no other. “We may be far in distance but close at heart. This collaboration with SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) is our Punggol Community’s way to show that we have our Muslim residents in our hearts, and we want to send them our festive good wishes – no matter how physically far apart we are.\nPenGwyn\nrepresents a kind, generous and loving young child of Punggol. He enjoys going around the neighbourhood to wish our residents well, while learning more about them and caring for them. I am grateful to SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) for investing their creative and artistic talents in this collaboration, and I look forward to working together on more projects in the future,” she said.\nKai Lun shared that the project has helped him gain a deeper understanding of different cultural practices and nuances, while allowing him to exercise his creative skills. “I cherish the insights and learning experiences gained. As we live in a multi-racial and multi-religious society, it’s important to ensure that\nPenGwyn\nis portrayed as sociable, friendly and inclusive. It’s been great to be part of the meaningful collaboration that SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) have with Punggol West Constituency,” shared Kai Lun, who is currently imparting his design and interactive media skills as a part-time educator.\nIt is the second time such a project has been rolled out by SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) with Punggol West Constituency. As part of a year-long project consisting of collaterals and design work for various festivities, SIT and DigiPen (Singapore) had previously assisted in the creation of the\nPenGwyn\nmascot, as well as its launch at the Punggol West Spring Lantern Festival (Yuan Xiao Jie). Kai Lun, along with fellow DigiPen (Singapore) BFA alumnus Lee Wee Tat, had designed the mascot and worked on the\ncommunity video\nfor the festival.\nThe mascot will continue to be featured in various collaterals for the Punggol West Constituency Office, with the most recent roll-out being a Sticker Pack specially made for this COVID-19 situation. Each sticker features a reminder on hygiene and safe distancing measures. The Sticker Packs for Android and iOS users are available for download here:\nWhatsApp sticker pack\nTelegram sticker pack\nTopics\nFeatures\nDesign\nAlumni\nCommunity\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nIndustry & Community\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nThe Voice Finders: 10 Questions with Speech Therapist Dr Valerie Lim\nview\nNext\nSafe Re-opening of SIT Campuses\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
