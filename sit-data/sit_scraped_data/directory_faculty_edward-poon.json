    "The Palliative Nursing Competency Framework (PNCF) is a guide to provide clarity on the roles, responsibilities and associated competencies for nurses working in the palliative care settings.",
    "Nurses, employers and course providers may use the PNCF as a reference to set job role expectations, develop training roadmaps and design workplace-based nursing education courses.",
    "The PNCF is applicable to all settings ranging from primary care to acute care and community care. The framework lists 7 Job Role Profiles (JRPs) for all the 12 job roles identified in the palliative care nursing sector, and 14 Professional Competencies (PCs) organised into 4 competency domains.",
    "The Palliative Nursing Competency Framework Development Workgroup has identified the following",
    "6 existing and emerging skill areas",
    "which are crucial in palliative care. Nurses are encouraged to further develop their competencies in these areas to improve the overall care plan for patients with life-limiting illnesses.",
    "Holistic symptom assessment and management",
    "Management of pain and other symptoms, including not only physical but also psychosocial and spiritual, should be assessed and addressed in a holistic manner instead of episodic care.",
    "Grief and Bereavement Support",
    "Providing a support system for patients, families, and caregivers to cope with losses during the patient’s illness journey, as well as bereavement.",
    "Psychosocial and Spirituality",
    "Apart for physical care, other aspects should also be taken into consideration such as psychosocial and spirituality which includes providing counselling and treating patients with dignity. Individualized psychosocial and spiritual care, regarding the patient as a whole, is key in promoting an appropriate response to the patient’s unique needs and the dying process.",
    "Inter-professional Collaboration",
    "Holistic care for patients would require close collaborations with other healthcare professionals such as doctors and therapists, as well as clinicians from other specialty areas.",
    "Conversations",
    "Palliative care nurses should be familiar with and initiate various conversations with patients, families, and caregivers as early as possible. These include conversations on Advance Care Planning, serious illnesses, and end-of-life care discussion.",
    "Outcome Measures",
    "Using analytical tools and methods to measure palliative care outcomes of patient’s health over time and influence disease modification by gaining insights to a patient’s illness and dying experience.",
    "The National Strategy for Palliative Care, accepted by the Ministry of Health in 2012,",
    "outlined ten key goals for palliative care in Singapore",
    ". Among them was that there should be local standards of care to ensure the delivery of good quality palliative care",

    "The National Strategy for Palliative Care (NSPC) Review Workgroup was convened in 2022 to evaluate gaps in the existing provision of palliative care over the past decade, chart out a vision for the sector, and formulate recommendations and guidance for implementing plans to achieve this vision.",
    "This report summarises the Workgroup’s findings, and proposes a new NSPC 2023 framework, which sets the future direction for the palliative care development in Singapore. The framework focuses on three focus areas of Access, Quality and Palliative Care Environment, with eleven recommendations, implementation plans and indicators to track progress. The Workgroup has also set out aspirational targets for the sector to achieve in the next 5 years, that will ensure better access, quality and palliative care environment for all.",

    "The Palliative Nursing Competency Framework (PNCF) is a guide to provide clarity on the roles, responsibilities and associated competencies for nurses working in the palliative care settings.\nNurses, employers and course providers may use the PNCF as a reference to set job role expectations, develop training roadmaps and design workplace-based nursing education courses.\nThe PNCF is applicable to all settings ranging from primary care to acute care and community care. The framework lists 7 Job Role Profiles (JRPs) for all the 12 job roles identified in the palliative care nursing sector, and 14 Professional Competencies (PCs) organised into 4 competency domains.\nThe Palliative Nursing Competency Framework Development Workgroup has identified the following\n6 existing and emerging skill areas\nwhich are crucial in palliative care. Nurses are encouraged to further develop their competencies in these areas to improve the overall care plan for patients with life-limiting illnesses.\nHolistic symptom assessment and management\nManagement of pain and other symptoms, including not only physical but also psychosocial and spiritual, should be assessed and addressed in a holistic manner instead of episodic care.\nGrief and Bereavement Support\nProviding a support system for patients, families, and caregivers to cope with losses during the patient’s illness journey, as well as bereavement.\nPsychosocial and Spirituality\nApart for physical care, other aspects should also be taken into consideration such as psychosocial and spirituality which includes providing counselling and treating patients with dignity. Individualized psychosocial and spiritual care, regarding the patient as a whole, is key in promoting an appropriate response to the patient’s unique needs and the dying process.\nInter-professional Collaboration\nHolistic care for patients would require close collaborations with other healthcare professionals such as doctors and therapists, as well as clinicians from other specialty areas.\nConversations\nPalliative care nurses should be familiar with and initiate various conversations with patients, families, and caregivers as early as possible. These include conversations on Advance Care Planning, serious illnesses, and end-of-life care discussion.\nOutcome Measures\nUsing analytical tools and methods to measure palliative care outcomes of patient’s health over time and influence disease modification by gaining insights to a patient’s illness and dying experience.",

    "2023 National Strategy for Palliative Care Report\nWith an ageing population and increasingly diverse healthcare needs, the demand for palliative care services is projected to rise.\nThe National Strategy for Palliative Care (NSPC) Review Workgroup was convened in 2022 to evaluate gaps in the existing provision of palliative care over the past decade, chart out a vision for the sector, and formulate recommendations and guidance for implementing plans to achieve this vision.\nThis report summarises the Workgroup’s findings, and proposes a new NSPC 2023 framework, which sets the future direction for the palliative care development in Singapore. The framework focuses on three focus areas of Access, Quality and Palliative Care Environment, with eleven recommendations, implementation plans and indicators to track progress. The Workgroup has also set out aspirational targets for the sector to achieve in the next 5 years, that will ensure better access, quality and palliative care environment for all."
