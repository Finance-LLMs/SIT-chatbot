    "How Universities Can Build on Classroom Knowledge to Tackle Social Gaps",
    "Find out how the Singapore Institute of Technology’s new social innovation centre empowers students to take on community challenges.",
    "In 2021, students from the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) designed the gamification features for a mobile application to help preschoolers and their parents from lower-income households learn about healthy eating. Students and faculty members from diverse academic disciplines came together to gamify content that would appeal to the young ones and encourage parent-child bonding.",
    "This is just one of the many projects currently facilitated by the",
    "Community Leadership and Social Innovation Centre (CLASIC)",
    "at SIT. Established in October 2020, CLASIC is a one-stop centre that curates, optimises, and tracks community initiatives and projects across SIT. Its mission is to deepen students’ understanding of societal needs and motivate them to draw on their knowledge to benefit the community beyond SIT.",
    "CLASIC’s Director,",
    "Professor Yaacob Ibrahim",
    "and Deputy Director,",
    "Associate Professor Intan Azura Mokhtar",
    "weigh in on how CLASIC helps to set SIT apart in the higher education space.",
    "Staying Grounded in the Community Through SIT’s Curriculum",
    "CLASIC brings together SIT students and faculty to craft interdisciplinary, practical solutions to address community gaps. It taps the university’s faculty members and Professional Officers’ research and expertise to propose solutions to real-life issues and challenges faced in the community. The Centre also collaborates with industry and community partners to provide expert knowledge and strengthen the resource pool for these student projects.",
    "“CLASIC projects attempt to draw on the knowledge and skills of SIT students from degree programmes across various academic clusters and domains,” says Prof Yaacob. Based on the requirements of each project, CLASIC garners the support of faculty members and Professional Officers with the relevant knowledge and skills to mentor the students, and bring the projects to fruition.",
    "SIT is placing community at the core of its curriculum. From academic year 2022, incoming cohorts of all SIT programmes will have to undertake a credit-bearing Social Innovation Project module managed by CLASIC. Students will identify and develop solutions to address challenges or problems faced by identified beneficiaries in the community, and the society at large. The university is already piloting the module across five degree programmes in academic year 2021.",
    "Both the integration of social context elements and the Social Innovation Project module in the SIT curriculum are overseen and managed by CLASIC.",
    "“Social context allows students to better understand Singapore’s or the region’s challenges and opportunities, as well as the perspectives of different groups of stakeholders in Singapore or the region in specific social issues related to students’ disciplines of study,” says A/Prof Intan.",
    "“The Social Innovation Project module allows students to collaborate with beneficiaries in the community on a current social issue or a gap faced by that group, and co-create solutions to address that social issue or gap. By putting our students through these experiences in our SIT curriculum, we hope to develop our students, so they are not just industry-ready, but also socially-astute,” she adds.",
    "Instilling a Ground-up Appreciation of Social Issues",
    "CLASIC projects empower students to better understand the nuances of complex social problems and community needs.",
    "This has proven to be a valuable learning experience for second-year",
    "Mechanical Engineering",
    "student, Ravichandran Pradeep Kumar, who was part of the student project team of a recently concluded engineering-based project. In collaboration with ECOSOFTT, an international water solutions social enterprise, and advised by their SIT Engineering and Design professors, the team created a smart water meter to help lower-income families track and optimise their water usage.",
    "As engineering students, the team came into the project with the mindset that “completing the project meant success,” reflects Pradeep. However, they soon learnt that the beneficiaries’ needs and preferences was another essential consideration.",
    "“From design considerations to safety and usage, our project revolved around ensuring the device did not cause any discomfort to the household members,” says Pradeep. Unlike in a classroom setting, executing the project “with empathy for human factors and considerations” was what truly brought the project to life.",
    "CLASIC has since awarded a $15,000 grant to the team, led by Engineering faculty",
    "A/Prof Steven Tay",
    ", to further develop the product and to conduct a trial in rental flats. The Singapore Plumbing Society has generously agreed to sponsor the installation of the devices in 20 pilot households.",
    "Pradeep (far left) and his teammates from the SIT-University of Glasgow Mechanical Engineering programme, (from left) Shaun Yong Yu Zhe, Muhammad Hilmi bin Hut, Muhammad Zulhusni bin Jumat, and Koh Liang Jie.",
    "To support community engagement even outside of curriculum requirements, CLASIC’s project grant scheme funds students’ social innovation and community projects. It also connects the students with the relevant SIT teams or community partners who can help them realise their project ideas.",
    "Nurturing Compassionate and Confident Youths of Tomorrow",
    "Real-world impact is at the core of CLASIC’s projects. “The guiding principle and end objective is to enhance the quality of life of identified beneficiaries in the community,” Prof Yaacob explains.",
    "Students actively draw on their academic knowledge to craft projects. “We hope that in turn, the experience would inform their professional practice, and motivate them to do more within their profession and capacity to benefit the community beyond SIT,” says Prof Yaacob.",
    "CLASIC projects equip students with skills to excel beyond the classroom as well. “We live in a world full of uncertainties,” says Prof Yaacob. Youths need to be “agile, resilient, and have a growth mindset” to tackle the challenges head-on, he adds.",
    "CLASIC’s initiatives allow all students to better understand cultural or social differences and nuances in our society; learn to work effectively with people from different walks of life; strengthen their project management abilities; and build self-confidence – skills that have proven to be invaluable in and out of the workplace.",
    "Since its inception, CLASIC has harnessed SIT students’ academic potential, supporting beneficiaries through practical solutions and innovations. With an expanded curriculum and growing support from industry stakeholders and community partners, the Centre is set to nurture thoughtful, empathetic, and confident SIT students who are not just industry-ready, but socially-attuned, for years to come.",

Students and faculty members from diverse academic disciplines came together to gamify content that would appeal to the young ones and encourage parent-child bonding.\nThis is just one of the many projects currently facilitated by the\nCommunity Leadership and Social Innovation Centre (CLASIC)\nat SIT. Established in October 2020, CLASIC is a one-stop centre that curates, optimises, and tracks community initiatives and projects across SIT. Its mission is to deepen students’ understanding of societal needs and motivate them to draw on their knowledge to benefit the community beyond SIT.\nCLASIC’s Director,\nProfessor Yaacob Ibrahim\nand Deputy Director,\nAssociate Professor Intan Azura Mokhtar\nweigh in on how CLASIC helps to set SIT apart in the higher education space.\nStaying Grounded in the Community Through SIT’s Curriculum\nCLASIC brings together SIT students and faculty to craft interdisciplinary, practical solutions to address community gaps. It taps the university’s faculty members and Professional Officers’ research and expertise to propose solutions to real-life issues and challenges faced in the community. The Centre also collaborates with industry and community partners to provide expert knowledge and strengthen the resource pool for these student projects.\n“CLASIC projects attempt to draw on the knowledge and skills of SIT students from degree programmes across various academic clusters and domains,” says Prof Yaacob. Based on the requirements of each project, CLASIC garners the support of faculty members and Professional Officers with the relevant knowledge and skills to mentor the students, and bring the projects to fruition.\nSIT is placing community at the core of its curriculum. From academic year 2022, incoming cohorts of all SIT programmes will have to undertake a credit-bearing Social Innovation Project module managed by CLASIC. Students will identify and develop solutions to address challenges or problems faced by identified beneficiaries in the community, and the society at large. The university is already piloting the module across five degree programmes in academic year 2021.\nBoth the integration of social context elements and the Social Innovation Project module in the SIT curriculum are overseen and managed by CLASIC.\n“Social context allows students to better understand Singapore’s or the region’s challenges and opportunities, as well as the perspectives of different groups of stakeholders in Singapore or the region in specific social issues related to students’ disciplines of study,” says A/Prof Intan.\n“The Social Innovation Project module allows students to collaborate with beneficiaries in the community on a current social issue or a gap faced by that group, and co-create solutions to address that social issue or gap. By putting our students through these experiences in our SIT curriculum, we hope to develop our students, so they are not just industry-ready, but also socially-astute,” she adds.\nInstilling a Ground-up Appreciation of Social Issues\nCLASIC projects empower students to better understand the nuances of complex social problems and community needs.\nThis has proven to be a valuable learning experience for second-year\nMechanical Engineering\nstudent, Ravichandran Pradeep Kumar, who was part of the student project team of a recently concluded engineering-based project. In collaboration with ECOSOFTT, an international water solutions social enterprise, and advised by their SIT Engineering and Design professors, the team created a smart water meter to help lower-income families track and optimise their water usage.\nAs engineering students, the team came into the project with the mindset that “completing the project meant success,” reflects Pradeep. However, they soon learnt that the beneficiaries’ needs and preferences was another essential consideration.\n“From design considerations to safety and usage, our project revolved around ensuring the device did not cause any discomfort to the household members,” says Pradeep. Unlike in a classroom setting, executing the project “with empathy for human factors and considerations” was what truly brought the project to life.\nCLASIC has since awarded a $15,000 grant to the team, led by Engineering faculty\nA/Prof Steven Tay\n, to further develop the product and to conduct a trial in rental flats. The Singapore Plumbing Society has generously agreed to sponsor the installation of the devices in 20 pilot households.\nPradeep (far left) and his teammates from the SIT-University of Glasgow Mechanical Engineering programme, (from left) Shaun Yong Yu Zhe, Muhammad Hilmi bin Hut, Muhammad Zulhusni bin Jumat, and Koh Liang Jie.\nTo support community engagement even outside of curriculum requirements, CLASIC’s project grant scheme funds students’ social innovation and community projects. It also connects the students with the relevant SIT teams or community partners who can help them realise their project ideas.\nNurturing Compassionate and Confident Youths of Tomorrow\nReal-world impact is at the core of CLASIC’s projects. “The guiding principle and end objective is to enhance the quality of life of identified beneficiaries in the community,” Prof Yaacob explains.\nStudents actively draw on their academic knowledge to craft projects. “We hope that in turn, the experience would inform their professional practice, and motivate them to do more within their profession and capacity to benefit the community beyond SIT,” says Prof Yaacob.\nCLASIC projects equip students with skills to excel beyond the classroom as well. “We live in a world full of uncertainties,” says Prof Yaacob. Youths need to be “agile, resilient, and have a growth mindset” to tackle the challenges head-on, he adds.\nCLASIC’s initiatives allow all students to better understand cultural or social differences and nuances in our society; learn to work effectively with people from different walks of life; strengthen their project management abilities; and build self-confidence – skills that have proven to be invaluable in and out of the workplace.\nSince its inception, CLASIC has harnessed SIT students’ academic potential, supporting beneficiaries through practical solutions and innovations. With an expanded curriculum and growing support from industry stakeholders and community partners, the Centre is set to nurture thoughtful, empathetic, and confident SIT students who are not just industry-ready, but socially-attuned, for years to come.\nThis article first appeared in\nGovInsider\n.\nTopics\nFeatures\nCLASIC\nInterdisciplinary Education\nSITizens\nCommunity\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nEngineering\nIndustry & Community\nAcademic Clusters\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nOrientation 2021: SIT First Year Experience\nview\nNext\nWhen the Path of Adversity Fuels Passion\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
