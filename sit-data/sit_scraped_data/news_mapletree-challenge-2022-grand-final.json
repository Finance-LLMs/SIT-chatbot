The two winning teams each walked away with a cash prize of $5,000 and the winners’ trophies.\nTeam\nRADnovation\n, comprising six Year 2 Mechanical Engineering students, created a portable rehabilitation device that allows patients to perform exercises from home.\nThe Gastronauts\n, made up of five Year 2 Food Technology students, proposed to repurpose spent coffee ground to grow oyster mushroom in a growing kit.\nThe Mapletree Challenge Grand Final was held at Mapletree Business City on 5 May 2022. Guest-of-Honour\nMs Low Yen Ling, Minister of State, Ministry of Trade & Industry and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth\ngraced the event and presented the awards to the top three winners.\nSIT President Professor Chua Kee Chaing\nsaid, “We are delighted to continue partnering Mapletree to inspire another batch of SITizen thinking tinkerers who will potentially make meaningful contributions to society. The Mapletree Challenge complements the University’s pedagogy perfectly in that it enables our students to use their knowledge and skills to innovate and address problems of concern to society.”\nMr Edmund Cheng, Mapletree’s Chairman\nsaid, “The Mapletree Challenge has continued to support SIT students in their entrepreneurial journey for the third year running. We are glad to see SIT students constantly innovating and coming up with new ways to live sustainably. It is our hope that The Mapletree Challenge will inspire them to dream big and make a difference in today’s world through their innovations.”\nThis year’s Challenge with the theme,\nImproving Our World through Sustainability and Innovation\n, saw the participation of 120 SIT students in a series of face-to-face and virtual training and mentorship programmes in the preparation stage of the Challenge. From January to May 2022, these participants attended six masterclasses on personal leadership, value pitching and financial literacy; a forum discussion on entrepreneurship and sustainable innovation by leading young entrepreneurs; as well as small group mentorship from industry experts on their entrepreneurial ideas.\nTen teams were selected to compete in the semi-finals, with five teams progressing to the Grand Final to vie for the Mapletree Gold, Mapletree Silver and Mapletree Bronze awards, which carry cash prizes of S$5,000, S$3,000 and S$2,000, respectively. Winners may also receive support to prototype their ideas.\nSome of the ideas presented by the other teams include a sustainable water generation equipment that converts oxygen into water using solar energy, a mobile app for cyclists, and producing fish fingers from locally sourced ingredients with the lowest carbon footprint.\nFirst launched in 2018, the Mapletree Challenge is a series of programmes that aims to promote entrepreneurship innovation, problem-solving and presentation finesse among SIT undergraduates. By providing a platform for them to present their business ideas, the Challenge hopes to inspire students to become future sustainable innovators.\nThe two Mapletree Gold teams – The Gastronauts (in white) and RADnovation (in black) – with MOS Low Yen Ling at The Mapletree Challenge 2022 Grand Final.\nExchange of token of appreciation between Mr Chua Tiow Chye, Deputy Group Chief Executive Officer, Mapletree (left) and Prof Chua Kee Chaing, SIT President (right), witnessed by MOS Low Yen Ling (centre).\n---\nAbout Singapore Institute of Technology\nThe Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is Singapore’s first University of Applied Learning, offering industry-relevant degree programmes that prepare its graduates to be work- and future-ready professionals.

Team RADnovation hopes to bring convenience and relieve to patients from the comfort of their homes with the creation of a portable rehabilitation device. The device allows patients to perform exercises from home and the performance indicators can be tracked remotely by the physiotherapist or occupational therapist through data transmitted from the device to an online platform. The remote tracking function of the portable device can detect if the patient is doing the physical activity correctly or are skipping their rehabilitation sessions. Team RADnovation hopes to create a prototype of the device and do test trial runs in rehabilitation centres and hospitals.\nTeam members:\nClaire Chia Hui Shi, Mechanical Engineering, Year 2\nAlexander Quah Zhi Wei, Mechanical Engineering, Year 2\nSng Shan You, Mechanical Engineering, Year 2\nLeow Xue Zi, Junise, Mechanical Engineering, Year 2\nRamasamy S/o Subramaniam, Mechanical Engineering, Year 2\nWillie Goh Jia Wei, Mechanical Engineering, Year 2\nThe Gastronauts\nSpent coffee ground is a natural and sustainable resource that is packed with rich nutrients and can be repurposed and used for the production of biodiesel. The Gastronauts proposed repurposing spent coffee ground into growth substrate for oyster mushroom. This would be packaged into an oyster mushroom growing kit which typically takes a week to grow the mushroom. The proposed kit aims to help reduce wastage of coffee grounds and encourage self-sustainability by growing our own food.\nTeam members:\nRita Tay Ru En, Food Technology, Year 2\nChua Yuan Shen Raphael, Food Technology, Year 2\nLoh Jia Hao Sean, Food Technology, Year 2\nLam Yun Jia Nurice, Food Technology, Year 2\nTan Yi Shan, Food Technology, Year 2\nMapletree Bronze\n($2,000 cash)\nBikePass\nBy 2030, Singapore’s cycling path network will be expanded to 1,320km.
