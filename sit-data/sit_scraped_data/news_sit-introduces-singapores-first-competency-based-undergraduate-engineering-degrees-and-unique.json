In the Academic Year 2025 (AY2025), SIT will be launching two new engineering degree programmes delivered through the CBE approach: the\nBachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)\nand the\nBachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Infrastructure and Systems Engineering (ISE)\n. By transitioning to CBE, SIT builds on its applied learning foundation, focusing on the mastery of competencies that align with industry needs. This ensures that students not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also demonstrate tangible skills and abilities, making them industry-ready from day one.\nIn addition, SIT is launching the\nBachelor of Integrated Studies (Honours) in Business and Infocomm Technology with dual specialisations in Hospitality and Tourism Management, and Artificial Intelligence [BISBICT (HTM & AI)]\n, Singapore's first interdisciplinary degree programme that integrates the specialisations of a business domain with that of an emerging technology from the first year of studies. This is in recognition that technology is an integral part of everyday life and a driving force in every industry. This new integrated degree is targeted at business students who want a deeper dive into how Infocomm Technology (ICT) can transform their professional field.\nTrailblazing CBE for Undergraduate Engineering Degrees\nThe EEE and ISE programmes are the first-of-its-kind engineering degree programmes delivered through the CBE approach. This approach emphasises practical mastery of key competencies, shifting away from traditional academic curricula. The curriculum comprises a blend of modules and learning blocks, specifically designed to help students acquire and master skills that are directly applicable to real-world engineering problems.\nEach learning block is self-contained to train students to acquire a set of related competencies. It includes an integrated project based on real-world scenarios, allowing students to apply and demonstrate their newly acquired competencies. This authentic approach, which was first adopted in SIT's\nCompetency-based Stackable Micro-credential Pathway\nfor adult learners, prepares graduates to tackle industry demands more effectively and efficiently. (\nRefer to Annexes A and B for more information on CBE and the two Engineering degree programmes.\n)\n“At SIT, we believe in nurturing graduates who are knowledgeable, industry-relevant and future-ready. Our new programmes demonstrate our dedication to evolving education in line with rapid technological advancements and workplace disruptions. By focusing on real-world competencies, we are not only preparing our students to excel in ever-changing environments but also shaping the future of industries across Singapore and beyond,” said\nProfessor Chua Kee Chaing, SIT President\n.\nIntegrating Business Expertise and Technological Innovation to Groom Future-ready Graduates\nSIT will also introduce the interdisciplinary four-year BISBICT (HTM & AI) degree programme. The curriculum reflects Singapore’s push for digital transformation in industries like hospitality, addressing the urgent need for professionals who can modernise business operations while driving digital transformation, enhancing enterprise competitiveness and operational efficiency\n[1]\n.\nThe programme is designed to equip future hospitality and tourism professionals with deep expertise in business fundamentals and advanced skills in applying AI. From the first year of study, industry-focused business core modules are infused with ICT elements to ensure that students understand how to leverage technological advancements to optimise and transform business processes. This integrated skillset is crucial as industries navigate digital disruption and seize opportunities for growth. (\nRefer to Annex C for more information on the degree programme.\n)\nCurriculum Alignment for Business, Communication and Design Programmes\nTo better align with industry needs and enhance accessibility, SIT is introducing a standardised curriculum framework for its Business, Communication and Design (BCD) cluster. As part of this initiative, the university will rename four programmes under the cluster starting from AY2025 to provide clearer pathways for polytechnic graduates and reflect the comprehensive skill sets these degrees offer.\nRevised Degree Programmes Names (from AY2025)\nCurrent Programmes Names\na.\nBachelor of Business (Honours) in Accountancy (ACC)\nBachelor of Accountancy (ACC)\nb.\nBachelor of Business (Honours) in Aviation Management (ATM)\nBachelor of Science in Air Transport Management (ATM)\nc.\nBachelor of Business (Honours) in Communication and Digital Media (CDM)\nBachelor of Science in Digital Communications and Integrated Media (DCIM)\nd.\nBachelor of Business in Hospitality (Honours) and Tourism Management (HTM)\nBachelor of Hospitality Business (BHB)\nThe updated curriculum will feature a harmonised structure, including shared Business Core modules in the first year across all BCD programmes. These modules range from a set of fundamental topics (such as Business Economics and Corporate ESG and Business Ethics) to functional subjects (such as Business Law and Applied Business Analytics). This integration equips students with essential interdisciplinary knowledge and skills in areas such as data analytics, sustainability, and digital transformation while preserving the specialised training required by their chosen fields. Through this unified approach, SIT reinforces its commitment to producing industry-ready graduates who can navigate the complexities of a rapidly evolving business and technological landscape.\nAY2025 Admissions Exercise\nFor AY2025, SIT will offer 40 undergraduate degree programmes, of which 25 are SIT-conferred, 11 are joint degrees, and 4 are offered by overseas university partners. SIT also offers 4 postgraduate coursework degree programmes and 4 industrial postgraduate degree programmes by research.\nVisit\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/undergraduate-programmes\nfor the full list of degree programmes. Applications for admission to SIT in AY2025 open from 8 January to 19 March 2025 at\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate\n.\nOpen House 2025\nThe SIT Open House will be held on 8 and 9 February 2025 at the SIT Punggol Campus for the first time. The Open House will offer prospective students and their families the chance to discover the university’s suite of degree programmes and experience how SIT provides a holistic, applied learning education. Those interested can explore the events calendar and register their interest to attend SIT’s Open House 2025 at\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/openhouse\n.\nANNEXES\nAnnex A – Competency-based Education (CBE) Pioneered by SIT\nCompetency-based Education (CBE) focuses on mastering specific skills and knowledge, emphasising learning outcomes and real-world application. SIT is introducing two first-of-its-kind Engineering degree programmes based on the CBE model. These programmes emphasise practical skills and knowledge that can be directly applied in the workplace. This forward-thinking approach reinforces our commitment to equipping learners with the tools to thrive in an evolving workplace.\nTraditional engineering degrees typically take a bottom-up scaffolding approach, with mathematics, physics, and engineering fundamentals taught in isolation in the initial years. This progressively builds up to a focus on smaller engineering components, then to larger systems of greater sophistication over the learners’ candidature.\nOur CBE approach presents a new paradigm of learning by shifting away from the traditional curriculum to an enhanced curriculum structured around self-contained\nLearning Blocks\nthat allow learners to master a set of competencies that are relevant to a professional role in real engineering practice. Some examples of the Learning Blocks in the two new Engineering degree programmes include:\nEEE: Electronic Systems, Sensing and Actuation, Semiconductor Manufacturing & Process Control\nISE: Engineering Design and Solutioning, Smart Maintenance\nEach Learning Block includes an integrated hands-on real-world project to apply what the student has learnt. This approach ensures graduates are well-equipped to meet industry needs.\nAnnex B – About the New Engineering Degree Programmes on the CBE Model: Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)\nand\nBachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Infrastructure and Systems Engineering (ISE)\nElectrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)\nEEE is a 4-year honours programme designed to train skilled professionals for Singapore's electronics industry and other sectors that rely on electrical and electronic engineers.
