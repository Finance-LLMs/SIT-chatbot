Board governance can,\nhowever, change under three poten-\ntial circumstances.\n\u0000R\u0000e\u0000s\u0000p\u0000o\u0000n\u0000s\u0000e\u0000s\u0000 \u0000t\u0000o\u0000 \u0000s\u0000c\u0000a\u0000n\u0000d\u0000a\u0000l\u0000s\nFirst, external events, such as major\ncorporate scandals or market up-\nheavals, can lead to strengthening of\ngovernance rules to avert future oc-\ncurences.\nFor example, the collapse of oil gi-\nant Enron prompted the Sarbanes-Ox-\nley Act of 2002, leading US regulators\nto mandate strict reforms to existing\nsecurities  regulations.  Likewise,\ntougher penalties were imposed by\nregulators across the region, in the af-\ntermath of the Asian Financial Crisis\nin 1997.\n\u0000I\u0000n\u0000t\u0000e\u0000r\u0000n\u0000a\u0000t\u0000i\u0000o\u0000n\u0000a\u0000l\u0000 \u0000g\u0000o\u0000v\u0000e\u0000r\u0000n\u0000a\u0000n\u0000c\u0000e\u0000\n\u0000s\u0000t\u0000a\u0000n\u0000d\u0000a\u0000r\u0000d\u0000s\nSecond, changes can be brought\nabout by best practices encoded\ninto rules or codes of governance,\narising from  international  best\npractices or standards. The Code of\nCorporate Governance (CG Code)\nin Singapore was last revised in\n2018 to take into account the\nbroader changes in the regulatory\nenvironment and corporate prac-\ntices. For example, since the CG\nCode was first introduced in 2003,\nthere has been a broad shift in\nboard independence.\nIt is generally accepted interna-tionally that an independent board\nstrengthens the governance of a\ncompany. Board independence en-\nsures that the board undertakes de-\ncisions in the best interests of the\ncompany. This fosters trust and\ntransparency that the board is dis-\ncharging its fiduciary responsibilit-\nies. It provides assurance that the\nboard is not beholden to a specific\ngroup of stakeholders or individu-\nals.\nThe latest findings from the Singapore Directorship Report pub-\nlished by the Singapore Institute of\nDirectors shows a general trend to-\nwards greater board independence\nsince the first edition of the report\nin 2014. This is borne out on sev-\neral fronts.\nA measure of board independ-\nence is the presence of an inde-\npendent chairman and the propor-\ntion of independent directors on\nthe board. And the latest report in-\ndicates that the proportion of pub-licly listed companies with inde-\npendent chairmen has increased to\n30.8 per cent in 2021, from 18.4\nper cent in 2014. Additionally,\nthere is a general shift towards the\nseparation of CEO and chairman,\nwith 75.1 per cent of companies re-\nporting  different  individuals\nserving as board chairman and CEO\n(as compared to 67.1 per cent in\n2014).\nOverall, the percentage of inde-\npendent directors on boards has in-\ncreased to 54.5 per cent in 2021,\nup from 47.5 per cent in 2014. The\npercentage of firms with half or\nmore independent directors on\ntheir boards has grown steadily\nsince 2014, with 77.7 per cent in\n2021, up from 54.5 per cent in\n2014. Boards with at least two-\nthirds of independent directors\nhave increased to 18.5 per cent in\n2021, from 10.0 per cent in 2014.\nThese shifts could be due to a\nchange in Provision 2.2 of the CG\nCode which from the 2018 edition\nnow provides that “independent\ndirectors make up a majority of the\nboard where the chairman is not in-\ndependent”.  Director  independ-\nence has been the focus of other\nregulatory changes. For example,\nthe Singapore Exchange is rolling\nout the so-called nine-year rule from Jan 1, 2022, where an inde-\npendent director who has been a\nmember of the board for more than\nnine years has to seek two-tier\nshareholder approval to continue\nas an independent director.\n\u0000S\u0000o\u0000c\u0000i\u0000e\u0000t\u0000a\u0000l\u0000 \u0000s\u0000t\u0000a\u0000n\u0000d\u0000a\u0000r\u0000d\u0000s\nThird, changes in corporate gov-\nernance can evolve through time,\nas companies adapt to broad shifts\nin the environment and societal at-\ntitudes. Gender diversity on boards\nis a case in point. With women rep-\nresenting half the talent pool, it is a\nstark reality that less than one in 10\nboard directors were women in\n2014 (9.7 per cent). While the pro-\nportion of women directors on\nSingapore corporate boards has in-\ncreased to 13.4 per cent in 2021,\nthis reflects a continuing imbal-\nance in corporate leadership.\nEvolutionary  progression  re-\nquires significant amounts of pa-\ntience, as the glacial rate of in-\ncrease in board gender diversity\n(0.53 per cent per year) shows. At\nthis rate, 30 per cent representa-\ntion of women directors on boards\nwill only be achieved by 2052. For\nthe top 100 listed companies by\nmarket capitalisation, women dir-\nectors comprise 17.2 per cent of\nboards. This indicates that larger\ncompanies could be slightly more\nreceptive to increase in board\ngender diversity.Issues surrounding gender di-\nversity are not confined to the\nboardroom, and unconscious bias\ncannot be addressed by regulation\nalone. Similarly, as the impact of cli-\nmate change and digital transform-\nation becomes more urgent, corpor-\nate governance will have to adapt\nto reflect trends in these land-\nscapes.\nThe increasing focus on environ-\nmental,  social  and  governance\n(ESG) matters has also prompted\nthe establishment of at least eight\nboard-level sustainability commit-\ntees among larger-cap companies\nin 2021. With SGX proposing man-\ndatory climate-related financial dis-\nclosures and reporting, the drive to-\nwards greater board-led focus on\nESG issues will continue.\nThe arrival of special purpose ac-\nquisition company (SPAC) listings\nwill also introduce new challenges\nto the role and composition of dir-\nectors. Watch this space as changes\nare expected in board governance\nas boards and regulators consider\nthe  challenges.  The winds  of\nchange in board governance will\ncontinue to shape the regulatory\nlandscape.\nThe writer is a member of the\nSingapore Directorship Report 2021\nworking committee at the Singapore\nInstitute of Directors.The  winds  of  change  in  board  governance\nThe latest Singapore Directorship\nReport indicates that the\nproportion of publicly listed\ncompanies with independent\nchairmen has increased to\n30.8 per cent in 2021, from\n18.4 per cent in 2014.\nBT  FILE  PHOTO\nMore  changes  expected  as  boards  and  regulators  respond  to  external  events,  international  best  practices,  and  shifts  in  social  attitudes.
