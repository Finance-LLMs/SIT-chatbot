    "Ultrasound plays a crucial role in the evaluation and management of patients with hepatobiliary and kidney diseases.",
    "The module is introduced in response to the industry demand and government healthcare policy in expanding capacity in skills upgrading of the current healthcare workforce.",
    "It is designed for ultrasound practitioners such as radiographers or sonographers who wish to pursue a formal postgraduate qualification in ultrasound. Hybrid instruction mode will be employed which combines online lectures, case-based/problem-based tutorials, forum discussion sessions, and practical hands-on demonstrations. The module is offered concurrently with supervised clinical practice to develop competency in abdominal ultrasound.",
    "Learners will be equipped with the core principles and applications of abdominal ultrasound. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scan in trauma setting and various advanced imaging techniques such as transplant ultrasound, elastography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound will also be covered. Intensive hands-on practical sessions on healthy volunteers and simulators will be conducted to complete the knowledge and skillset acquisition in abdominal ultrasound.",
    "They will also cover topics such as gross anatomy and physiology, embryology, and clinical indications. Learners will gain insights into equipment and patient preparation, as well as techniques and sonographic protocols for evaluating key abdominal structures. This includes liver, gallbladder, biliary system, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, and major abdominal vessels. They will also focus on understanding normal sonographic anatomy and identifying abnormal imaging findings.",
    "At the end of this module, learners will be able to recognise the normal and abnormal ultrasound findings and will be guided in the competent production, interpretation, and assessment of abdominal ultrasound images.",
    "Who Should Attend",
    "Radiographers practising ultrasound",
    "Healthcare professionals involved in ultrasound work",
    "Prerequisites",
    "Participants must have relevant ultrasound related experience (preferably at least 1 year of working experience as an independent sonographer).",
    "Candidates must have the required access to a medical ultrasound facility to develop competency in the respective clinical applications. They must be actively engaged in supervised ultrasound clinical practice in the workplace for at least three days (or equivalent) per week. It is the candidate's responsibility to secure a supervised clinical arrangement in the workplace. At the end of the trimester, candidates must satisfy the clinical requirements (i.e., compulsory logging of the required number of ultrasound examinations in the clinical portfolio and pass the clinical skills assessment).",

    "Dr. Ooi specialises in ultrasound modality since 2001. She graduated with a Diploma in Diagnostic Radiography from Nanyang Polytechnic in 1998, Bachelor of Applied Science (Medical Imaging) in 2000 from Charles Sturt University, Australia and Master in Medical Sonography in 2008 from Monash University, Australia. She has completed her PhD in Medical Imaging at Monash University. Her research area focuses on the application of advanced ultrasound imaging technique, namely ultrasound elastography, in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of musculotendinous problems. Her current research investigates the role of ultrasound elastography in early diagnosis of liver fibrosis and portal hypertension in patients suffering from chronic liver disease. She has received a number of competitive research grants, including the SingHealth Foundation and SGH Research Grant. Dr. Ooi is currently holding Joint Appointment at Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and was adjunct faculty at Nanyang Polytechnic. She is involved in teaching and training of junior radiographers, medical students and residents.  She is currently the PGAHI (Post Graduate Allied Health Institute) faculty trainer and workshop instructor. She presents regularly at local and international conferences and seminars.",
