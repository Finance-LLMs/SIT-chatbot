Two of its buildings are certified as Super Low Energy buildings. SIT Campus Court welcomed its first students from the Business, Communication and Design (BCD) and Infocomm Technology (ICT) Clusters in September 2024.\nCampus Court\nAbout SIT Campus Court\nSIT Campus Court, designed by RSP, faces Coney Island. The buildings in SIT Campus Court incorporate green technologies, including natural daylight harvesting and solar panels. The Kwek Leng Beng University Tower, Ho Bee Auditorium, indoor sports hall, and Super Low Energy buildings can be found here.\nPrincipal Architect, RSP\nSuen Wee Kwok, Director, RSP\n“At the end of the day, what will remain imprinted on the students’ minds is the campus experience and interaction they have with their friends outside of the classroom.” - Suen Wee Kwok, Director, RSP\nSIT Campus Court was designed with the concept of a courtyard in mind — to create a fluid learning and campus experience. We placed emphasis on creating spaces that promote interaction and participation, through the inclusion of many big and small courtyards, with hard and soft landscapes. These conducive spaces become natural centrifugal forces that bring people together to foster an exchange of ideas and for learning to take place, even outside the classrooms.\nchevron--up\nCampus Heart\nAbout SIT Campus Heart\nSIT Campus Heart is a \"Campus-in-a-Park\" designed by WOHA Architects. Uniquely endowed with an existing secondary forest, the design capitalises on this green site asset by integrating its learning environments with biophilic indoor-outdoor tropical spaces.\nPrincipal Architect, WOHA Architects\nWOHA’s founding directors, Richard Hassell and Mun Summ Wong (left to right). Credits: Studio Periphery\n“We conserved 1.7Ha of the existing forest and designed a “Campus-in-the-Park\", that is characterised by memorable place-making nodes and biophilic learning environments for students to enjoy and delight in.” - Mr Wong Mun Summ, Founding Director of WOHA\nTo forge an evocative “Campus-in-a-Park” identity, the academic blocks are organised as a chain of buildings encompassing the central forest courtyard, which has been transformed into an accessible Community Park.\nSIT Campus Heart serves as the heart of SIT, contributing to a strong sense of place characterised by memorable nodes for learning, interaction, recreation and rejuvenation. You can find the library, a sheltered event plaza, and the Hatchery building here.\nchevron--up\nConstruction Site Gallery\nCampus Court\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n❮\n❯\nCampus Heart\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n❮\n❯\nFrequently Asked Questions\nchevron--up\nHow big is the Punggol Campus?\nSIT’s Punggol Campus, situated within JTC’s Punggol Digital District (PDD), occupies a total land area of approximately nine hectares.
