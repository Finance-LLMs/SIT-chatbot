    "Demands for advanced clinical supervision competency in Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) have escalated over the past decade.",
    "Multiple efforts such as the conversion of AHP Entry level training from a Diploma to 4 years of Bachelor study (Hon), the introduction of the Pre-Employment Clinical Training (PECT) fund, as well as the enaction of Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC) supervisory framework have increased the accountability of clinical departments to provide high-quality clinical training and assessment to AHP students and new graduates. Clinical supervisors and educators play key roles in assessing progress, facilitating learning, and supporting the well-being of learners at the workplace. It is therefore critical for clinical supervisors and educators to deliver cost-effective clinical training using evidence-based education practices.",
    "This Certificate in Clinical Supervision is designed to equip AHP clinical supervisors and educators with the intermediate-level competencies to provide effective clinical training to AHPs and students. It aims to support clinical supervisors and educators to learn, use, and reflect on the application of evidence-based education theories and skills in clinical supervision at the workplace. The programmatic approach also seeks to develop capability and confidence amongst senior AHP educators to support the culture of teaching and learning at their workplaces through coaching junior educators.",
    "This 2.5-month competency-based education programme is designed based on the “clinical teaching and supervision” and “reflective practice” competencies in the Skills map for senior AHPs under the Skills Framework for Healthcare.",
    "Learning activities will comprise e-learning, workshops, peer feedback, group coaching, and workplace application and reflection. Advanced competency will be established through multiple modes of assessment such as quizzes, short answer questions, OSTE (Objective Structured Teaching Exercise), workplace assessment, and video presentation. The programme will be delivered by SIT faculty, together with experienced workplace clinical supervisors and educators.",
    "The accelerated pathway has a shorter course duration, is targeted at learners with at least 5 years of clinical experience, who have attended at least one relevant clinical education workshop/programme, and supervised at least 4 AHPs or students as the main clinical supervisor or educator.",
    "Who Should Attend",
