    "‘Social innovation’ is a current slogan for the many initiatives and projects done by groups keen to make a positive differences or social impact in the various communities in our society.",
    "What is ‘social innovation’? According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2021), “social innovation refers to the design and implementation of new solutions that imply conceptual, process, product, or organizational change, which ultimately aim to improve the welfare and wellbeing of individuals and communities”. There are numerous initiatives and projects undertaken and implemented globally by the social economy and by civil groups, which have proven to be innovative in dealing with socio-economic and environmental problems, while contributing to the economic development of individuals, families, communities, and even societies. With the race to achieve the 17 United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs) by the year 2030 and abide by the framework proposed by the Paris Agreement that was ratified by almost all countries globally in 2015, our educational landscapes have simultaneously evolved to incorporate more initiatives related to communities, social issues, and global challenges, and prepare our young for the world’s most pressing issues that are ever-evolving and which require more flexible, and adaptive solutions that are co-created with users.",
    "The intent of this project is to learn from the best practices of selected higher education institutions (HEIs) in the US and Southeast Asia that have implemented social innovation projects or initiatives in their HEI curricula and compile these best practices into a framework of attributes and principles that can be a guide for HEIs across Southeast Asia to use in planning their social innovation projects or initiatives that can support the UN SDGs.",

We propose to conduct field research on understanding how Web 3.0 technologies support digital social innovation that leads to positive outcomes in socio-economic transformation and sustainable development. What would be the effective role of social entrepreneurship?",

In other words, at the heart of social innovation or enterprise is providing value to society rather than seeking profit. However, when social innovation is driven by technology, a new phenomenon emerges, known as digital social innovation appears (Rodrigo et al. (2022),",
    "Digital social innovation (DSI), technologically based or digitally enabled approaches to collective social problems, is a new field of study that has recently gained an increasing degree of scholarly interest (Certomà, 2022; Suseno and Abbott, 2021).

SET is widely explained as measures and changes that are primarily meant to alleviate societal problems, encourage equitable growth, and raise citizens’ standard of living in general. In bringing about a more inclusive and sustainable socioeconomic environment, SET may entail modifications to institutions, laws, norms, and behaviors.  Another key construct for the proposed research is the notion of sustainable development. Here, we may take a pragmatic view by categorically drawing from the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [see",
    "https://sdgs.un.org/goals",
    "] and make the postulation that sustainable development is the outcome (ie sustainability) when any combination of SDGs is fulfilled. Among the many technical definitions of sustainability (eg net zero carbon) is the classic one found in the Brundtland (1987) Report which holds that sustainable development is growth and progress without jeopardizing future generations.",
    "In the UAE context, much emphasis has been placed on digital transformation in industry and society. Social innovation and enterprise have been significant components of these initiatives.  For example, the UAE’s “Green Agenda – 2030” is a long-term plan to achieve the goals of sustainable development and make its economy more environment-friendly. Its strategy includes various programs and initiatives to achieve them such as: (i) a competitive knowledge economy; (ii) social development; and (iii) improved quality of life, among others. But whereas digital technologies such as cloud and 4G networks, social media, and IoT devices have been effectively utilized to support the vision, the emergence of Web 3.0 requires a rethink and update to many of these “business as usual” practices, however good or effective they are.  DSI provides such an avenue for discovery, fresh thinking, and experimentation.  This proposal outlines exploratory research on how Web 3.0 may be effectively used to support DSI and bring about positive socio-economic transformations and sustainable development to specific communities and society at large",

    "Older adults face barriers to technology adoption compared to the younger generation (Wang et al. 2019). The rise in technological advancement over the years has significantly pushed for the implementation of technology among various age groups (Kim & Choudhury, 2020). However, age may be a factor that can influence technology usage and adoption. Factors that can affect technology adoption can be attributed to the lack of knowledge, where older adults perceived as being inferior and unconfident with the usage of technology (Turner et al. 2007). As a result, they are likely to associate negative emotions such as anxiety when using technology. Other factors that can negatively impact technology adoption can be associated with limited mobility and poor visual acuity that may cause difficulty when using technology (Wang et al. 2019). In contrast, lower cost, positive attitudes, and perceived benefit, and ease of use of technology may drive usage among older adults (Elers et al. 2018; Peek et al. 2016; Hsiao et al. 2015).",
    "The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the barriers and facilitators of using VR technology in the community hospital setting, using fully immersive 3-D simulation with goggles, headphones and controller providing a 360-degree view of Lorong Buangkok. The specific aim is to discover perspectives and experiences of VR usage in the local community hospital setting from various key stakeholders (patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers) in terms of the barriers and facilitators. Understanding the experiences and perspectives stakeholders may inform how technology usage and adoption can facilitate better therapy compliance that will in turn reduce manpower requirements for therapy.",

    "Currently, households will not be able to identify the specific activities that cause the water wastage should there be a surge in water usage. Water is used for a range of household activities, and it will be difficult to identify which activity is causing the wastage. PUB has worked with Ecosoft to install mechanical water meters at water points of several households for them to monitor and understand their water usage. However, this method is difficult and inaccurate as users need to manually record the readings every day for a period of 2-3 weeks. One reading a day will be insufficient to analyse and pinpoint the activities that cause the wastage. There is also the issue of human errors during reading and recording of the readings. The objective of this project is to develop and install smart water meters to monitor water usage at different outlets within households. The smart meter to be developed should be able to store data for a period of 2-3 weeks. After the trial period, data can be retrieved and analysed to determine the water usage of the different water points of the household. User will be able to better understand their usage behaviour and adjust their behaviour to save cost.",

    "Role: Principal Investigator\nFunding: (1) US leg of the project: Fulbright US-ASEAN Visiting Scholar Award, US Department of State; (2) Southeast Asia leg of the project: To be confirmed\nProject Overview\n‘Social innovation’ is a current slogan for the many initiatives and projects done by groups keen to make a positive differences or social impact in the various communities in our society.\nWhat is ‘social innovation’? According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2021), “social innovation refers to the design and implementation of new solutions that imply conceptual, process, product, or organizational change, which ultimately aim to improve the welfare and wellbeing of individuals and communities”. There are numerous initiatives and projects undertaken and implemented globally by the social economy and by civil groups, which have proven to be innovative in dealing with socio-economic and environmental problems, while contributing to the economic development of individuals, families, communities, and even societies. With the race to achieve the 17 United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs) by the year 2030 and abide by the framework proposed by the Paris Agreement that was ratified by almost all countries globally in 2015, our educational landscapes have simultaneously evolved to incorporate more initiatives related to communities, social issues, and global challenges, and prepare our young for the world’s most pressing issues that are ever-evolving and which require more flexible, and adaptive solutions that are co-created with users.\nThe intent of this project is to learn from the best practices of selected higher education institutions (HEIs) in the US and Southeast Asia that have implemented social innovation projects or initiatives in their HEI curricula and compile these best practices into a framework of attributes and principles that can be a guide for HEIs across Southeast Asia to use in planning their social innovation projects or initiatives that can support the UN SDGs.",
    "Role: Collaborator/Co-Investigator\nFunding: Social Innovation Award, Zayed University, Abu Dhabi\nProject Overview\nThe research objective of this project is to investigate how digital social can bring about positive socio-economic transformation and drive sustainable development through the use of innovative Web 3.0 technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and the Metaverse (see for example, Dey 2022 for an overview of Web 3.0). We propose to conduct field research on understanding how Web 3.0 technologies support digital social innovation that leads to positive outcomes in socio-economic transformation and sustainable development. What would be the effective role of social entrepreneurship?\nTechnological advancements have boosted social innovations within the world economy by way of facilitating cross-border value chains, promoting inclusive participation, and generating new jobs in developing nations (Enciso-Santocildes et al., 2021).\nSocial\ninnovation\nrefers to activities and services that are motivated by the goal of meeting various societal needs and fostering innovative spatial design while valuing the social and cultural aspects of the community (Galdini and De Nardis, 2023; Suseno and Abbott, 2021). In other words, at the heart of social innovation or enterprise is providing value to society rather than seeking profit. However, when social innovation is driven by technology, a new phenomenon emerges, known as digital social innovation appears (Rodrigo et al. (2022),\nDigital social innovation (DSI), technologically based or digitally enabled approaches to collective social problems, is a new field of study that has recently gained an increasing degree of scholarly interest (Certomà, 2022; Suseno and Abbott, 2021). A closely related concept is the resulting\nsocioeconomic\ntransformation\n(SET) that drives more concrete quality-of-life outcomes. SET is widely explained as measures and changes that are primarily meant to alleviate societal problems, encourage equitable growth, and raise citizens’ standard of living in general. In bringing about a more inclusive and sustainable socioeconomic environment, SET may entail modifications to institutions, laws, norms, and behaviors.  Another key construct for the proposed research is the notion of sustainable development. Here, we may take a pragmatic view by categorically drawing from the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [see\nhttps://sdgs.un.org/goals\n] and make the postulation that sustainable development is the outcome (ie sustainability) when any combination of SDGs is fulfilled. Among the many technical definitions of sustainability (eg net zero carbon) is the classic one found in the Brundtland (1987) Report which holds that sustainable development is growth and progress without jeopardizing future generations.\nIn the UAE context, much emphasis has been placed on digital transformation in industry and society. Social innovation and enterprise have been significant components of these initiatives.  For example, the UAE’s “Green Agenda – 2030” is a long-term plan to achieve the goals of sustainable development and make its economy more environment-friendly. Its strategy includes various programs and initiatives to achieve them such as: (i) a competitive knowledge economy; (ii) social development; and (iii) improved quality of life, among others. But whereas digital technologies such as cloud and 4G networks, social media, and IoT devices have been effectively utilized to support the vision, the emergence of Web 3.0 requires a rethink and update to many of these “business as usual” practices, however good or effective they are.  DSI provides such an avenue for discovery, fresh thinking, and experimentation.  This proposal outlines exploratory research on how Web 3.0 may be effectively used to support DSI and bring about positive socio-economic transformations and sustainable development to specific communities and society at large",
    "Role: Co-Investigator\nFunding: To be confirmed\nProject Overview\nOlder adults face barriers to technology adoption compared to the younger generation (Wang et al. 2019). The rise in technological advancement over the years has significantly pushed for the implementation of technology among various age groups (Kim & Choudhury, 2020). However, age may be a factor that can influence technology usage and adoption. Factors that can affect technology adoption can be attributed to the lack of knowledge, where older adults perceived as being inferior and unconfident with the usage of technology (Turner et al. 2007). As a result, they are likely to associate negative emotions such as anxiety when using technology. Other factors that can negatively impact technology adoption can be associated with limited mobility and poor visual acuity that may cause difficulty when using technology (Wang et al. 2019). In contrast, lower cost, positive attitudes, and perceived benefit, and ease of use of technology may drive usage among older adults (Elers et al. 2018; Peek et al. 2016; Hsiao et al. 2015).\nThe purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the barriers and facilitators of using VR technology in the community hospital setting, using fully immersive 3-D simulation with goggles, headphones and controller providing a 360-degree view of Lorong Buangkok. The specific aim is to discover perspectives and experiences of VR usage in the local community hospital setting from various key stakeholders (patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers) in terms of the barriers and facilitators. Understanding the experiences and perspectives stakeholders may inform how technology usage and adoption can facilitate better therapy compliance that will in turn reduce manpower requirements for therapy.",

    "Role: Co-Investigator\nFunding: SIT CLASIC Project Grant\nProject Overview\nCurrently, households will not be able to identify the specific activities that cause the water wastage should there be a surge in water usage. Water is used for a range of household activities, and it will be difficult to identify which activity is causing the wastage. PUB has worked with Ecosoft to install mechanical water meters at water points of several households for them to monitor and understand their water usage. However, this method is difficult and inaccurate as users need to manually record the readings every day for a period of 2-3 weeks. One reading a day will be insufficient to analyse and pinpoint the activities that cause the wastage. There is also the issue of human errors during reading and recording of the readings. The objective of this project is to develop and install smart water meters to monitor water usage at different outlets within households. The smart meter to be developed should be able to store data for a period of 2-3 weeks. After the trial period, data can be retrieved and analysed to determine the water usage of the different water points of the household. User will be able to better understand their usage behaviour and adjust their behaviour to save cost.\nProject Deliverables\nDevelop a smart meter to record the water flow rate for a minimum period of 2 weeks;\nMass produce the smart meter to be installed in 20 households (estimated 4 per household);\nSupport the installation of smart meters in 20 low-income households for a period of two weeks (in two phases, each phase for 10 households);\nAnalyse the data captured to identify the usage behaviour of each household;  and\nAdvise the households accordingly and share findings with PUB",
    "Role: Principal Investigator\nFunding: SIT SEED Grant\nProject Overview\nKwong Wai Shiu Hospital (KWSH) is designing and planning their new nursing home for the elderly in Potong Pasir. As part of the planning, design and development of the new nursing home, KWSH intends to engage their stakeholders (elderly residents, staff members, etc.) to better understand their needs and expectations in terms of the features and provisions of the new nursing home. Two aspects are particularly important – access to assistance, and access to information – particularly when social interactions have to be limited and physical distance needs to be maintained, post-COVID-19. In addition, there are attendant constraints to the service provision and delivery that Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital may face such as manpower constraints, restrictions in social interactions and physical distancing between healthcare providers and residents, as well as ensuring effective design for better information and assistance access and provision.\nThis project seeks to achieve the following\nobjectives, in collaboration with KWSH\n:-\nIdentify the needs and expectations of the elderly residents\nWhen accessing services or assistance – be it human or technology-enabled;\nWhen accessing information required for independent living or self-care – be it human or technology-enabled; and\nIn the planning of the design and provisions of a new nursing home as their residence.\nProject Deliverables\nThe\nplanned deliverables/outputs\nof this small-scale project are:\nMap/framework of identified features of better design for access to and provision of information and assistance;\nReport of proposals, incorporating the identified features gathered through this project, to KWSH;\nPrototype co-created with KWSH, incorporating some or all of the identified features gathered through this project; and\nConference paper for presentation and publication.",

This CB is a national movement control order with the intention to reduce/eliminate the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and characterised by prohibitions from leaving the home, students engaging in home-based learning and employees working from home. More information can be found here:\nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/pm-lees-address-on-the-covid-19-situation-in-singapore-21-april-2020\nAt the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), we have had to quickly adapt our teaching and learning activities during the CB, largely to remote (online) deliveries, along with many other educational institutions. Changes include having all lessons and assessments, and various student events, conducted remotely via online means. Yet, there are voices from students suggesting more can be done to engage the them better, as there are limits to online teaching (Tan, 2020). Moreover, the Singapore government has been reiterating that, as a nation, we will be entering a new normal (Davie, 2020; Yong, 2020). As such, this study seeks to understand students’ engagement profile better so as to prepare for said new normal in education. This study also seeks to observe students’ engagement profile trajectory as they proceed along their undergraduate years of study.",
    "Role: Principal Investigator\nFunding: SIT Ignition Grant\nProject Overview\nSocial sustainability is an increasingly important concept in urban development and renewal. Other than looking at preserving the greenery, ecosystems, and physical environment, urban scientists are also looking at ensuring the conservation of social capitals, social cohesion and the general well-being of people involved (Panagopoulos, Duque & Dan, 2016; Weingartner & Moberg, 2011).\nThere is keen interest in capturing the multi-sensory experience of individuals as they interpret what they sense or recall, what they interpret of their surrounding environments, landscapes and experience, and at the same time, improve the process of harvesting, processing and disseminating this information (Monteiro, Painho & Vaz, 2015). In addition, with increasing demand for public participation in the process of urban conservation and planning, and heritage conservation, social sustainability and sustainable urban redevelopment cannot be achieved without the involvement of communities and individuals (Najd,\net al.\n, 2015).\nIn Singapore, Kampong Lorong Buangkok is the last remaining village or\nkampong\non the mainland. It has come under threat of having to make way for urban redevelopment as indicated in the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Masterplan 2014. In its place, the kampong is supposed to be replaced by a 3-lane bi-directional highway, 2 schools (primary and secondary), and a public park. There is thus a need to capture and document as much information and history about the kampong before it eventually makes way for urban redevelopment.\nThis project seeks to achieve the following objectives:\n(a)           Compilation of oral history accounts by the residents still living in the kampong, who have seen changes in the kampong and its surrounding areas from pre-independence (1956) to present day, where such oral history accounts will be able to provide rich insights into the social changes that have happened in the kampong, a microcosm of multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore;\n(b)           Production of a detailed 3-dimensional layout of the kampong, harnessing virtual and/or mixed reality (VR/MR) technologies, that can be captured and displayed on various technological platforms in the future, whether online or in exhibitions, community showcases or roadshows. This is particularly important in preserving the memory of the kampong when it eventually makes way for urban redevelopment;\n(c)           Compilation of the above audio-visual, text-based and digital documentation will serve as a basis for cultural, heritage, historical and values education, and racial-religious understanding, among current and future generations of Singaporeans; and\n(d)           Opportunities for SIT students to be involved in an extensive social and community project that helps fulfil the fourth SIT-DNA of being ‘Grounded in the Community’.\nProject Deliverables\nThe deliverables for the project are:\nA compilation of the oral history accounts of the residents (audio-visual video clips and/or text publication such as a coffee table book);\nA technology-based audio-visual documentation of the kampong, including a 3-D physical model and a digital/360-degree interactive VR modelling of the kampong;\nAn online platform/website showcasing and documenting the oral history accounts, photographs, video footages, and 3D digital/VR modelling of the kampong; and\nCampus-wide exhibitions in SIT and community exhibitions (eg. in community centres) showcasing the above deliverables for SIT students and the general public to view and have access to the information collated.",
    "Role: Principal Investigator\nFunding: SIT SEED Grant\nProject Overview\nThere are a number of policy changes for the pre-school sector in Singapore over the past few years – from the pilot of a government-led and funded pre-school (MOE Kindergarten), and the setting up of a centralised training and research centre for pre-school educators (NIEC); to the increased numbers of pre-school anchor operators and partner operators, benchmarking and monitoring of pre-school education standards, and increased government funding, as well as the ramping up of pre-school centres to provide more pre-school places to meet demand.\nThis small-scale project seeks to provide an insight to the different ways that pre-school education leaders are leading change in their respective pre-school education centres, in light of these significant changes to the pre-school sector within the last couple of years. Interviews with pre-school education leaders will be carried out on how they lead change in their respective pre-school education centres in Singapore, along with the attendant challenges and issues faced.\nThese insights will also be useful for other pre-school educators and leaders seeking to explore ways to lead change within their respective pre-school education centres and the sector as a whole, so as to better manage and lead change within the sector.\nProject Deliverables\nTwo publications on project findings.",
    "Role: Co-Investigator\nFunding: SIT SALT Grant\nProject Overview\nGamification of students’ learning experience is rarely practiced. Yet, gamification has been shown to effectively generate students’ innate motivation to participate in learning. Based on the “Octalysis Framework” established by Yu-kai Chou, focus group discussions (FGDs) will be conducted with students, to develop relevant teaching & learning examples that would situate well in the SIT context. In addition, through interviews with industry partners and employers, this project seeks to ascertain meaningful competencies that are transferable to the workplace, thereby developing a workplace competency framework (WCF), which would further complement students' learning experience through gamification during their university journey.\nThe findings of this project will be translated to a list of teaching and learning activities (TLAs) to be incorporated into a few modules taught by SIT faculty. Interviews with a sample of students will be conducted to measure the efficacy of the TLAs developed based on actionable gamification characteristics.\nProject Deliverables\nTwo publications on project findings.",
