Apart from access to industry mentors, each of the six finalist teams were coached by a professional corporate trainer and a communications mentor. For the Challenge, participants were invited to develop robust concepts based on design-thinking methodologies, and propose products, practices or services to positively impact the community. The judges looked out for elements of desirability, functionality, marketability and sustainability of the innovative concepts presented, as well as the finalists’ presentation skills.",
    "Among some of the ideas presented were innovations that introduce an efficient recycling system for use in hotel rooms, a water-efficient toilet flushing system, tiles that convert footsteps into energy and data, a feminine hygiene product made of eco-friendly materials, as well as an alteration to the bicycle manufacturing process using sustainable practices. The judges were impressed by the teams’ creativity and impactful presentations which demonstrated their focus to implement concepts that allow business and sustainability to coexist.

    "This water efficiency system aims to eliminate water wastage in public restrooms, where users tend to commit “double/first flushing”, a redundant practice of flushing the toilet bowl before usage. The innovation also aims to improve restroom hygiene standards by integrating the antiseptic detergents with every flush. The technology, made up of both hardware and software aspects, takes into account the PH level of the standing water. Sensors and dispensers are to be installed in the toilet bowl, and a software programme will process the PH level readings to categorise if the water is “clean” or “dirty”. This will then allow the system to inform the user via an attached screen, who will then have a choice to select a non-flush or a half-flush, if the water is clean. A full flush will be activated if the standing water is found to be dirty. Antiseptic detergent will also be dispensed together with each flush to help eliminate bacteria.",
    "The innovative idea was developed in close consultation with SIT’s industry partner Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, who provided feedback on the issue of redundant first/double-flushing.",

    "Hotels have been found to top in energy consumption across various building types. To mitigate this, the team proposed for hotels to incorporate an existing tile technology system that converts patrons’ footsteps into energy and data. To be installed in high footfall areas such as hotels’ lobbies and function room foyers, the system could offset part of the hotels’ energy consumption. The innovation also proposes for an integration of Bluetooth connectivity to register event delegates seamlessly, eliminating the use of tickets and time required for registration. With customisable shapes, colours and textures to suit the hotels’ interiors, the tiles can help hotels reduce overall fossil fuel energy consumption, enhance data collection, and improve brand image through corporate social responsibility.",

    "Carbon fibre bicycle frame is sought after due to its light weight and ability to absorb vibration. However, the downside is its high cost. The Lapis Bike proposes an alteration to the manufacturing process by using 3D-printed moulds and inserts. The production and R&D costs can be reduced without compromising the structural integrity of the carbon fibre bicycle. Moulds can be melted back and subsequently reused for another new mould. The result is a bike frame made of carbon fibre, coupled with 3D-printed sandwiched structure, created from the stainable 3D-printed mould.",

Supported by Mapletree and spanning seven months from October 2019 to April 2020, the Challenge also provided students with a platform to pitch their entrepreneurial ideas on the theme. More information about\nThe Mapletree Challenge\nis detailed in\nAnnex 1\n.\nThe 44 teams, comprising a total of 152 participants, submitted their entries to vie for the Mapletree Gold, Mapletree Silver and Mapletree Bronze awards, which included cash prizes of S$5,000, S$3,000 and S$2,000 respectively, on top of the opportunity to prototype their innovations. Apart from access to industry mentors, each of the six finalist teams were coached by a professional corporate trainer and a communications mentor. For the Challenge, participants were invited to develop robust concepts based on design-thinking methodologies, and propose products, practices or services to positively impact the community. The judges looked out for elements of desirability, functionality, marketability and sustainability of the innovative concepts presented, as well as the finalists’ presentation skills.\nAmong some of the ideas presented were innovations that introduce an efficient recycling system for use in hotel rooms, a water-efficient toilet flushing system, tiles that convert footsteps into energy and data, a feminine hygiene product made of eco-friendly materials, as well as an alteration to the bicycle manufacturing process using sustainable practices. The judges were impressed by the teams’ creativity and impactful presentations which demonstrated their focus to implement concepts that allow business and sustainability to coexist. The full list of winners is in\nAnnex 2\n.\nProfessor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT said, “As Singapore’s university of applied learning, we create an environment where our students can apply the theories they have acquired to solve real-world problems with practical solutions. I am heartened that Mapletree and our industry friends continue to lend their support and mentorship despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. Our students have benefitted from their mentorship and sharpened their business acumen. With the increased awareness on the need to incorporate sustainable practices into businesses and our daily lives,\nThe Mapletree Challenge\ncontinues to be an important platform in preparing our students beyond academic pursuits.”\nMr Edmund Cheng, Mapletree’s Chairman said, “We were impressed with the entrepreneurial and creative solutions presented by SIT students in\nThe Mapletree Challenge\nlast year and are pleased to continue our support for the second year. The Challenge not only provides the SIT students with useful skills that they can apply after they graduate, it is also a platform for them to shape their ideas into authentic and marketable plans. In times of this pandemic period, we are heartened that the students stay resilient and motivated to bring forward their innovative ideas.”\nAnnex 1\nThe Mapletree Challenge\nin its entirety comprises the following components:\nJob Interview & Presentation Masterclasses\n(September to November 2019): Two sets of masterclasses focused on helping students refine job interview skills and personal branding, with the workshops directed by leading corporate trainers.\nThe Mapletree Innovation and Entrepreneurship Forum\n(12 March 2020): Panel discussion which focused on entrepreneurship, innovation and sustainability, featuring Mr Mandeep Chopra, Founder and Managing Director, Limited Edition; Ms Nichol Ng, Owner and Managing Director, FoodXervices Inc; Mr Prashant Dadlani, Founder and CEO, blu; Mr Uantchern Loh, CEO, Black Sun Asia Pacific; with moderator, Assistant Professor Victor Cole, Centre for Communication Skills, SIT.\nMentoring Masterclasses\n(20 March to July 2020): Coaching sessions on entrepreneurship and innovation and professional communication, which honed students’ entrepreneurial ideas, persuasive pitching and presentation skills.\nThe Grand Final\n(23 July 2020): Six competing student project teams presented entrepreneurial ideas for sustainable innovations, in a 10 to 15-minute presentation through vodcast submissions, to a panel of experts. The full list of prizes is in Annex 2, and the panel of judges is in\nAnnex 3\n.\nAnnex 2\nList of winners:\nPrize\nWinning Team & Members\nMapletree Gold\n(S$5,000 cash)\nTeam Paste Pods\nTo reduce the carbon footprint of the hospitality industry and eliminate single-use plastic toothpaste tubes prevalently used in hotels, Team Paste Pods proposed the use of seaweed abstracts as an alternative packaging. Innovative and environmentally friendly, Paste Pods is bio-degradable, edible, simple and convenient to be used. The low-cost packaging made of seaweed abstracts will also allow hotels to reduce overall cost.\nTeam members:\nIvan Low\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nAylmer Tan\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nRachelle Lim\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nTeo Pei Ling\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nMapletree Silver\n(S$3,000 cash)\nPush It, Don’t Trash It\nHotel room attendants often have to cope with housekeeping duties in short turnaround time. As a result, they may not efficiently sort out rubbish that could potentially be recycled.\nThe team proposed a set of innovative solutions to help hotels implement an effective recycling system, which includes an innovative room attendant trolley that allows for an efficient compartmentalisation of trash, a segregated waste bin for each guest room, along with an\ninstruction card to encourage guests on waste separation.\nTeam members:\nMarcus Chew Choon Yong\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nJocelyn Goh Wen Min\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nLee Jia Shing\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nMapletree Bronze\n(S$2,000 cash)\nSenses Blue\nThis water efficiency system aims to eliminate water wastage in public restrooms, where users tend to commit “double/first flushing”, a redundant practice of flushing the toilet bowl before usage. The innovation also aims to improve restroom hygiene standards by integrating the antiseptic detergents with every flush. The technology, made up of both hardware and software aspects, takes into account the PH level of the standing water. Sensors and dispensers are to be installed in the toilet bowl, and a software programme will process the PH level readings to categorise if the water is “clean” or “dirty”. This will then allow the system to inform the user via an attached screen, who will then have a choice to select a non-flush or a half-flush, if the water is clean. A full flush will be activated if the standing water is found to be dirty. Antiseptic detergent will also be dispensed together with each flush to help eliminate bacteria.\nThe innovative idea was developed in close consultation with SIT’s industry partner Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, who provided feedback on the issue of redundant first/double-flushing.\nTeam members:\nYam Shien Hui\n, Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services), Year 2\nTan Wei Kiat Nicholas\n, Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services), Year 2\nShannyn Tay Wei Lin\n, Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services), Year 2\nTeo Hwee Kee\n, Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services), Year 2\nConsolation Prizes\n(S$1,000 cash for each team)\nCare-turistics\nHotels have been found to top in energy consumption across various building types. To mitigate this, the team proposed for hotels to incorporate an existing tile technology system that converts patrons’ footsteps into energy and data. To be installed in high footfall areas such as hotels’ lobbies and function room foyers, the system could offset part of the hotels’ energy consumption. The innovation also proposes for an integration of Bluetooth connectivity to register event delegates seamlessly, eliminating the use of tickets and time required for registration. With customisable shapes, colours and textures to suit the hotels’ interiors, the tiles can help hotels reduce overall fossil fuel energy consumption, enhance data collection, and improve brand image through corporate social responsibility.\nTeam members:\nFelicia Tan\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nCharmaine Tan WanYi\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nValerie Lim Hui Na\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nLouisa Leung Jia Qi\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nLapis\nBikes\nCarbon fibre bicycle frame is sought after due to its light weight and ability to absorb vibration. However, the downside is its high cost. The Lapis Bike proposes an alteration to the manufacturing process by using 3D-printed moulds and inserts. The production and R&D costs can be reduced without compromising the structural integrity of the carbon fibre bicycle. Moulds can be melted back and subsequently reused for another new mould. The result is a bike frame made of carbon fibre, coupled with 3D-printed sandwiched structure, created from the stainable 3D-printed mould.\nTeam members:\nZulhusni Jumat\n, Mechanical Engineering, Year 1\nMuhammad Hilmi bin Hut\n, Mechanical Engineering, Year 1\nPang Yong Xun\n, Mechanical Engineering, Year 1\nVECO\nVECO aims to offer an eco-friendly solution to the ecological impact caused by disposable feminine sanitary napkins. The sustainable innovation improves on the current sanitary napkins available in the market by incorporating organic and hypoallergenic materials that are made from waste cotton loom, as well as biodegradable and anti-bacterial sources. VECO is made of two components - a refillable absorbent insert and a reusable holder. It is 100% plastic-free and made from organic materials.\nTeam members:\nBelicia Choong\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nKok Ee Lim\n, Hospitality Business, Year 2\nEach team will receive the medals and certificates at a prize-giving ceremony, which will be held later this year.\nAnnex 3\nPanel of judges:\nMr Eddie Chau, Founder & Chairman, Neeuro\nSerial entrepreneur Mr Eddie Chau was conferred IT Leader of the Year by SCS in 2018.
