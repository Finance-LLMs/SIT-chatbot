With the need to address issues from energy efficiency to urbanisation, innovative solutions are paramount.\nTechnology thrives in the\nElectrical and Electronic Engineering\ndiscipline at SIT, bridging electrical, electronics, and computing domains. Standing at this intersection, students contribute to shaping intelligent and sustainable systems, aligning with Singapore's vision for a smart and green nation.\nSmart Transportation\nAs Singapore advances its smart city initiatives, intelligent transportation systems play a pivotal role. Cars have evolved to be more than just a means of transportation; they are becoming sophisticated computers on wheels. This makes graduates from SIT’s\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Engineering\n(CEG) degree programme with a specialisation in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), highly sought after in an era where smart cities are on the rise. The ITS specialisation has specific modules in modern automotive technologies, cyber-physical systems, smart mobility and traffic management.\nComputer Engineering students working on an automotive instrument cluster development board in the RF & Electronics Lab at SIT@Dover. (SIT Photo: Andrew A.)\nThe degree programme's hands-on approach is reinforced through state-of-the-art laboratories, such as the Embedded Systems Lab, RF & Electronics Lab, and Transportation Systems Lab, with a huge screen that can visualise road maps and traffic flows. These labs provide the means for practical exercises and guided sessions that enable students to use professional equipment for their individual and group projects. Students can also try their hands on an autonomous vehicle and two smart lamp posts at the SIT@Dover campus to gain first-hand experience of future mobility and transportation technologies.\n“Within our CEG programme, we work on cutting-edge technologies such as autonomous mobility, electric cars or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. These technologies are used for applied research projects and are included in the curriculum where students can work with novel industry-relevant concepts and devices. The focus on intelligent transportation systems is a key highlight of SIT’s\nComputer Engineering\nprogramme,” said Assistant Professor\nPeter Waszecki\n, Programme Leader for the CEG degree programme.\nFrom Academic Year 2024 onwards, the Computer Engineering programme will include a Term-In Term-Out (TITO) pathway, where students will spend one trimester in each year of study, for a total of 16 months, on work attachment.\nPowering\nt\nhe\nF\nuture\nWith the global focus on finding sustainable solutions to collect, store, and utilise energy, the\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Electrical Power Engineering\n(EPE) programme, jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University, offers an industry-focused curriculum with electives in areas such as power and energy, renewable energy integration and electric transportation.\nA/Prof Sivaneasan Bala Krishnan (right) guiding Electrical Power Engineering students to troubleshoot the hardware of the buggy project designed and built by the students.\n(SIT Photo: Andrew A.)\nSIT’s new Punggol Campus – where classes will commence in September 2024 – will house the largest private microgrid in Singapore and the first Multi-Energy Microgrid (MEMG) on a university campus in Southeast Asia. This microgrid will be used to test Singapore’s future energy system and provide learning opportunities for students to understand how distributed energy systems interact with the grid. The MEMG will also serve as an experimental platform to support the research, development and test-bedding of distributed energy systems and cyber-physical system security solutions.\nTo equip students with knowledge and skill sets in sustainability within the power sectors and carbon footprint reduction, EPE students will take a minor in Environmental Sustainability. This aligns with the national sustainability agenda of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, in which the green economy has been earmarked as one of Singapore’s three growth areas.\n“The success of our graduates is evident, with a 97% employability rate. The EPE programme offers a unique blend of theoretical knowledge, hands-on experience, and global exposure, preparing graduates to be industry leaders in the evolving energy landscape,” said Professor\nAkshay Kumar Rathore\n, Programme Leader for the EPE degree programme.\nHumanoid Robots: From Fiction to Reality\nAs Singapore embraces automation and smart technologies, mobile robots are increasingly deployed in sectors from cleaning and security to food preparation and delivery. Recognising the surge in mobile robotics applications, SIT’s\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Robotics Systems\n(RSE) degree programme trains students to design and integrate complete mobile robotic systems from the ground up.\nRSE students working on software development project for autonomous mobile robot\n￼\n. (SIT Photo: Andrew A.)\nThe programme prepares students for dynamic careers at the intersection of systems engineering, software development, and robotics. Students learn to develop software tailored for engineering applications and seamlessly integrate hardware components to form robust and efficient systems.\nHands-on experience is a cornerstone of the RSE programme. A dedicated Robotics Systems Lab provides students with the necessary software and hardware for the practical application of knowledge to solve real-world problems. RSE students have participated in the James Dyson Award 2023, an international design competition, by developing prototypes demonstrating innovative solutions. They include a robotic system for sustainable solar panel cleaning and an alternating air mattress for bed sore prevention with pressure data feedback for prompt adjustment to improve the quality of care.\n\"Anticipating future trends, the programme prepares students for the rise of AI-enabled autonomous mobile robots. Our project-based pedagogy connects academic knowledge with real-world applications, allowing the seamless integration of diverse disciplines, fostering a holistic learning experience,” said Associate Professor\nLim Chun Yee\n, Programme Leader for the RSE degree programme.\nA G\nateway to\nIndustry Engagement and\nGerman\nE\nngineering\nE\nxcellence\nElectronics and Data Engineering students working on a smart gantry project at the SIT@SP Building. (SIT Photo: Andrew A.)\nThe\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Electronics and Data Engineering\n(EDE) programme, jointly offered by SIT and the Technical University of Munich (TUM), adds an international dimension to the programme and ensures students benefit from the latest German engineering practices. The EDE programme aligns with the industry's needs, catering to an increasingly digitalised world and the rapid adoption of 5G and AI.\nAccording to an EDB report for September 2023, the key electronics industry saw output grow 10.2 per cent year on year. Within electronics, infocomms and consumer electronics, production surged 21.6 per cent, semiconductors grew 13.5 per cent, and other electronics modules and components segments rose 4.7 per cent.\n[1]\n“The foundation modules cover circuit design and architecture, and essential mathematics for data engineering. The inclusion of new, industry-relevant modules like semiconductor fabrication, bioelectronics, and machine learning sets EDE apart and prepares students for diverse roles in electronics and data industries. EDE's curriculum integrates TUM's expertise in electrical engineering fundamentals with SIT's emphasis on industry engagement. The programme will be accredited by both Singapore and German accreditation bodies,” said Associate Professor\nZheng Jianxin\n, Programme Leader for the EDE programme.\nStudents can also go on a three-week Overseas Immersion Programme to Munich to attend workshops in TUM research labs and industry visits to renowned companies like BMW and Audi, and gain exposure to global engineering practices through interactions with TUM faculty, students and German engineers.\nThe application period for admission to SIT in AY2024 is from 10 January to 19 March 2024.
