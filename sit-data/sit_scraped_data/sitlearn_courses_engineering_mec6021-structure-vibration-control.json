    "All structures in realistic engineering systems are designed to resist vibrational forces caused by external or internal sources. With the advancements in technological processes and requirements for ultra-high precision, the amount of vibrations affecting system performance has to be significantly reduced. As such, it is important to comprehend, model, analyse, and control these vibrations.",
    "This module aims to cover the concept of structure vibration and control in physical systems. Using real world examples, various mathematical models, characteristics, performance, and stability of feedback control systems will also be introduced and evaluated. Furthermore, the effectiveness of controller design for proportional-integral-derivative controllers and appropriate compensators will be evaluated using Bode plots, root loci, and frequency response techniques. A case study on modeling and controlling vibrations of the voice coil motor in a commercial hard disk drive will also be discussed.",
