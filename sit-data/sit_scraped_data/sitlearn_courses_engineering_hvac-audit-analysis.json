    "Chiller plants are an essential part of buildings and consume a significant amount of energy.",
    "This course focuses on the fundamental operations of HVAC components (comprising chilled water and air handling systems), measurement, data acquisition, and analytics to determine the specific energy consumption (SEC) of the chilled water and air handling systems. During the course, participants will be tasked to measure and analyse at least 2 weeks of HVAC components raw data, propose potential energy-saving opportunities, and design improvement concepts through the group presentation. Assessment will be in the form of MCQ and group presentation.",
