Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education graced the main session held at The Theatre at Mediacorp.\nThe occasion marked the graduation of the inaugural  batch of 46 students from the Aircraft Systems Engineering (ASE) programme at\nSIT. Graduates from the first-of-its-kind three-year Bachelor degree programme by an Autonomous University in Singapore have\nundergone an interdisciplin ary curriculum that grooms them for the aerospace and aircraft Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO)\nindustries.\nThe university also graduated its first cohort of students from the Master of Science in Chemical Engineering programme. The\nprogramme equips mid-career  professionals with strong fundamentals and robust training in modern chemical  engineering technologies.\nBased on SIT's preliminary employment survey results, SIT graduates also remain employable amid the challenging economic climate.\n72% of the respondents from the university's Class of 2021 have secured employment since the completion of their studies, with\ngraduates from the Information and Communications Technology (Software Engineering) and Radiation Therapy programmes  attaining\n100% overall employment.\n\"Our students go through a rigorous curriculum that provides them with both a solid academic foundation and industry experience . In\nparticular, the IWSP provides students the opportunity to put theory into practice and learn from experience d professionals, over a\nduration of between eight to 12 months. This gives our students a competitive edge when they enter the workforce.  We also continue to\nensure the high relevance of our programmes, thanks  lo the strong collaboration with our industry partners,\" said Prof Tan Thiam Soon,\nPresident, SIT.\nThe Class of 2021 has been offered $2,000 worth of SITizens  learning Credits,  in line with the university's commitment to encourage\nlifelong learning. The Credits can be used to apply for Continuing Education and Training courses offered by SITLEARN Professional\nDevelopment, the lifelong learning division of SIT. Graduates can enroll in short courses, specialist certificates and modular certification\ncourses that are stackable towards Postgraduate Certificates, which will allow them to pick up new skillsets to complement the\ncompetencies acquired in their und ergraduate years.\nSIT also supports graduating students through the CCR, which organises career success workshops, recruitment talks, career fairs and\ncareer coaching sessions.\nStudents whose families have been impacted  by the pandemic can also tap on the Student Relief Fund at SIT (COVI0-19). Students\nmay also apply to join the Advancement  & Alumni Division's SIT Alumni Mentoring Programme, where they will be paired with alumni\nmentors who will share their professional knowledge and insights on work-study  balance.\nFor the full story, please go to SIT's Digital Newsroom: b.llps://www.singapo retech.edu.s g[Qjgitalnewsroom /sit-celeb rates-the­\ngrad uation-of- i ts-class-of-2 021/\nSeizing the Opportunity to Upskill\nAhmad Syahir is one of 26 workplace learners embarking on SIT's pilot Competency-Based Workplace Learning\nPathway, and will be the first in his family to obtain an undergraduate degree\nEl 05 November 2021\nAhmad Syahir has always wished that he could go back in time to do better in his studies so that he\ncould pursue higher education. Now, thanks lo a new initiative between SIT and key industry\npartners, the 30-year old undergraduate will now have the opportunity to realise his dream.\nIn September 2021, SIT has rolled out the Competency-Based Workplace Learning Pathway\n(CBWLP) in Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (SIE). Syahir is one of the 11 workplace learners\nfrom SBS Transit and SMRT Corporation looking to deepen their skill sets in rail engineering.\nIn addition, SIT also launched the pathway for the Infocomm Technology (Information Security)\ndegree programme, teaming up with leading cyber security firm Ensign InfoSecurity. The firm aims\nto build a core group of Singaporean cyber security professionals or 'cyber defenders' in the\ncoming years, and has committed to support the training of their employees. 15 workplace\nlearners from Ensign InfoSecurity have commenced their journey with SIT in this Academic Year 2021/22 as well.\nThis alternative route to an undergraduate  degree will allow adult learners to gain credits towards fulfilling degree requirements, based\non the competencies they have acquired through their past work experience. Most of the learning outcomes required to obtain their\ndegree will be achieved through curated projects carried out al work. Workplace learners will have access lo on line lectures for their\nrespective modules and receive facilitated coaching from SIT faculty through on line platforms. This approach provides learners with\ngreater flexibility and ownership over their learning journey and pace, and minimise disruptions to their work and personal lives.\n\"When I found out about this learning opportunity, I immediately seized it,\" said Syahir who has been working with SBS Transit for eight\nyears and specialises in facilities management. His family, especially his father, is supportive of him enrolling into the pathway. \"If\neverything goes smoothly, I would be the first in my family to obtain a degree!\" he quipped with delight.\nFor the full story, please go to SIT's Digital Newsroom : hiios;//w ww.sjngaporetech.edu.s gls;tigjtatnewsroom/sejzjn g�RP9C1 YDity�\nYQSkill/\nAhmad Syahir (right) conducting a check of the Water-Cooled Chillers at MRT stations. to ensure the desired temperature level at the stations is maintained.
