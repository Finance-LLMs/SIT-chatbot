However, they seem to lag\nbehind the large companies in big data analytics\nadoption. Often, the lower rate of adoption is\nattributed to certain limitations, such as cost\nconcerns, lack of data analytics understanding or lack\nof in-house expertise.\nThis study seeks to understand the adoption of data\nanalytics among Singapore SMEs by examining their\nreadiness and technological capability of adopting\ndata analytics, the extent of analytics tasks embraced,\nthe perceived “usefulness” of data analytics, and their\nreasons for adopting or rejecting data analytics.RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS\nA total of 575 SMEs took part in a questionnaire survey between November 2018 and\nApril 2020. The respondents were categorised into 3 groups:\nTo remain relevant, businesses must embrace\ndigitalisation and transform their business models to\nutilise technological advancements. Among these\ninnovations are data and analytics, which have\nbecome the heart of technological advancement\napplications. Digitalisation transforms the scale,\nquality and processing of data. This transformation\nwill produce vast quantities of data that businesses\ncan use to conduct decision-making optimisation\nanalyses to strengthen their business frontiers. Hence,\nit is important for all businesses to understand data\ngenerated by their businesses and to know ways to\nutilise advanced technologies to convert data into\npowerful business strategies.OVERVIEW\nThere are practical implications for SMEs’ management,\nindustry associations, professional bodies, data\nanalytics consultants and government agencies.Non-data analytics adopters are SMEs that have not\nadopted any data analytics in their organisations and have no\nintention to do so in the future. Despite their perception of the\npotential business values created by data analytics, these\nSMEs expressed scepticism that data analytics would\ngenerate real monetary savings for their organisations.\nLikely data analytics adopters are SMEs that have not\nadopted any data analytics in their organisations but are likely\nto embrace it in the future. Performance expectancies, effort\nexpectancies, management support and government support\nwere the factors that would increase their intention to\nimplement data analytics.Likely Data Analytics\nAdopters:\nRespondents\n(35.1%)202\nData analytics adopters are SMEs that have already\nembraced data analytics in their businesses. System quality\nand information quality have positive impacts on data analytics\nbusiness values which, in turn, lead to better organisation\nperformance. However, lack of understanding about data\nanalytics and concerns over data security and privacy can\ndeter SMEs from implementing data analytics roadmaps.Data Analytics\nAdopters:\nRespondents\n(30.3%)174 THE BUSINESS WORLD\nIS FACING TECHNOLOGY\nDISRUPTIONS THAT WILL\nRE-DEFINE BUSINESS\nMODELS AND STRATEGIES.\nNon-Data Analytics\nAdopters:\nRespondents\n(34.6%)199\n01 02\n01 02\nThe majority of respondents were in Director/Manager/Head of Department positions.

However, if they were to implement data analytics,\nthe main driver for adoption would be enhancing\nstaff productivity. Nonetheless, non-data analytics\nadopters remained sceptical over any real monetary\nsavings that might be generated for their organisations\nby adopting data analytics. To encourage these\nSMEs to implement data analytics, more needs to be\ndone. Sharing of success stories and providing\nreal-life examples on how potential monetary\nbenefits can be achieved with data analytics adoption\ncan be considered. As success stories spread among\nthe SMEs, more of them may be encouraged to\nconsider embracing data analytics as part of their\nbusiness model.\nThese respondents also reported the lack of IS infrastructure support, limited financial resources, and concern over\ndata protection and privacy as top potential deterrents for their organisations to adopt data analytics. Many of\nthem were familiar with only spreadsheet and database as tools of data analytics, suggesting a lack of\nunderstanding and awareness of more advanced data analytics tools.\nOpinion Crawl, Open Text,\nTrackur, and Semantria\nRapidMiner and Orange\nSAS, KNIME, MS Azure Machine\nLearning, BigML, and ApacheSpark\nTableau, Qlik Sense, Power\nBI, and Microstrategy\nR and Python\nMySQL, Ms Access, SQL\nServer and PostgreSQL\nGoogle Sheet and MS Excel47.8%\n25.8%\n0.4%9.2%\n2.5%5.7%8.6%\n01020304050Data Analytics Tools Overall Trend\nFriends/\nWord of Mouth25.9%\nGovernment/Quasi Agencies/\nProfessional Bodies14.7%\nSeminar/Workshop13.7%Supplier/Vendor12.6%Others1.1%\nSource of\nData Analytics\nAwarenessInternet/\nMass Communication32%\n11 12\nINSIGHTS\nLikely Data Analytics Adopters:\n202 Respondents\n(35.1%) Tableau, Qlik Sense, Power\nBI, and Microstrategy\nOthers\nRapidMiner and Orange\nOpinion Crawl, Open Text,\nTrackur, and Semantria\nSAS, KNIME, MS Azure Machine\nLearning, BigML, and ApacheSpark\nR and Python\nMySQL, Ms Access, SQL\nServer and PostgreSQL\nGoogle Sheet and MS Excel\nFriends/\nWord of Mouth19.8%\nGovernment/Quasi Agencies/\nProfessional Bodies15.5%Seminar/Workshop21.8%\nSupplier/Vendor10.9%Others0.2%\nSource of\nData Analytics\nAwarenessInternet/\nMass Communication31.8%Data Analytics Tools Overall Trend\n6.9%\n5.9%\n5.9%4.0%\n4.0%\n4.0%\n3.0%\n3.0%Software & ServicesMedia & EntertainmentInformation TechnologyFood, Beverage & TobaccoFinance\nRetailReal EstateEducation10.9% Engineering20.8%Commercial & Professional\nServices\nGovernment\nSupportPerformance\nExpectations\nManagement SupportResource\nAvailabilityAdoption Plan\nMarket Competition\nSystem CapabilitiesEase of\nImplementation\n3.89\n3.83\n3.733.87 3.87 3.86\n2.96\n3.56Contributing Factors of Implementation\n0510152025303540 38.0%\n26.0%\n4.6%\n0.7%17.5%\n4.1%9.0%\n0.1%\n13 14*Top 10 industry sectors\n*5-point Likert scale\nAlthough they had not adopted data analytics, they were interested to implement databases,\ndata visualisation and reporting, as well as spreadsheet applications. In particular, the most useful\ntask for their organisations would be conducting data visualisations to provide reports and\nconvey findings. However, this group appeared to have limited awareness about more advanced\ndata analytics tools. The majority of them were aware of spreadsheet application analytics tools\nand database management, but they lacked the understanding of advanced data analytics tools\nfor visualisation analyses or programming analyses. When these SMEs view that data analytics\ncan help them to perform tasks and solve problems, they will likely be interested to implement\nsuch technology. Individual attributes of user experience, task usefulness or technologies\ncapabilities do not influence their intention to adopt data analytics. These respondents had not adopted any data analytics in\ntheir organisations but were likely to embrace it in the future.\nData\nAnalytics\nTasksDatabase\nSpreadsheet\nText AnalysisData Visualisation & Reporting\nSocial Media Analysis\nLocation Tracking Analysis\nGlobal Positioning Systems Analysis\n26.1%\n24.9%\n23%\n10.8%\n2.6%4.1%8.5%\nINSIGHTS\nGovernment financial support is needed to minimise\nthe implementation cost burden. However, while\ngovernment support via grants is widely available,\nSMEs face difficulty tapping these grants. For some\nfinancial assistance schemes, SMEs may need to\nprovide upfront funds to implement digitalisation\ntransformation before they are able to take advantage\nof the financial schemes. For resource-scarce SMEs,\na better, streamlined funding support framework is\nneeded to entice them to implement data analytics.\nOther key drivers that would encourage these\nrespondents to adopt data analytics include having a\ngood and easy adoption implementation plan and a\nhigh expectation of realising better firm performance\nfor their organisations. As these SMEs are open to\nlearning about how data analytics can benefit their\norganisations, having a shared services platform that\nthese SMEs can tap could be very useful in keeping\ncost down.  Such a platform can be set up with consultants to\nprovide different levels of data analytics capabilities,\nfrom basic to advanced. Basic implementation refers\nto the use of databases and spreadsheets to arrange\nthe vast quantities of data that businesses can use\nto conduct decision-making optimisation analyses.\nIntermediate implementation refers to the ability to\nproduce data visualisation and reporting. Advanced\nimplementation refers to the ability to use advanced\nanalysis tools such as social media analysis, text\nanalysis, location tracking analysis and global\npositioning systems analysis. SMEs can select the\nappropriate level of implementation to suit their needs.To increase their intention of data analytics implementation,\nthese likely data analytics adopters cited government support as\nthe chief means of assistance with implementing data analytics.\n15 16\n3.9/5.0\n3.9/5.0\n4.0/5.0\n3.9/5.0\n4.0/5.0\n4.0/5.0\n3.9/5.0\n4.0/5.0\n4.0/5.0\n3.9/5.0\nStaff reluctant to changePotential Deterrents\nLack of understanding of data analytics\nLack of information systems\ninfrastructure support\nShortage of data analytics expertise\nboth in-house and in the labour market\nUncertainty about how to measure\ncosts and potential benefits\nLimited financial resources\nfor data analytics investment\nLack of intuitive software\nConcerns over data security\nConcerns over data\nprotection and data privacy\nRe-assignment of personnel\ntrained on data analytics solutions\n01\n02\n03\n05\n07\n09\n04\n06\n08\n10Data Analytics Adopters:\n174 Respondents\n(30.3%)\n11.5%\n9.2%\n8.0%\n8.0%\n7.5%6.3%\n5.7%\n2.9%\n2.9%\n2.3%Healthcare Equipment\n& ServicesTechnology Hardware\n& EquipmentMedia & EntertainmentRetailInformation Technology\nFood, Beverage & TobaccoFinanceEducationCommercial & Professional\nServicesEngineering\nBusiness Value\n4.1/5.0\n4.0/5.0\n4.1/5.04.1/5.0\n4.0/5.0\n4.0/5.0\n3.9/5.0\n4.1/5.0Increase efficiency of business\nprocess management\nReduce operating costs\nIncrease efficiency of workforce\nIncrease returns on\nfinancial assets\nEnhance staff productivity\nRespond quickly to change\nImprove customer relations\nProvide better customer service\n1\n2\n5\n6\n7\n8\n3\n4$INSIGHTS\n17 18*Top 10 industry sectors\n*5-point Likert scale\nFriends/\nWord of Mouth11.0%\nGovernment/Quasi Agencies/\nProfessional Bodies18.0%Seminar/Workshop23.7%\nSupplier/Vendor18.0%Others1.0%\nSource of\nData Analytics\nAwarenessInternet/\nMass Communication28.3%\nThe data analytics tools they reported having used\nvaried from basic software such as MS Excel to more\nsophisticated software such as SAS and Tableau.\nWhile many of these adopters had implemented data\nvisualisation and reporting, they had not explored\ntext analysis, social media analysis, global positioning\nsystems analysis or location tracking analysis. More\nthan 80% of the respondents indicated that they had\nperformed various data analytics tasks such as data\ncleansing and standardisations, data manipulation to\nuncover trends and insights, and data visualisations to\nprovide reports and convey findings. Given that these\nrespondents are data analytics adopters, it is not\nsurprising that most of them would report data\ntransfer to/from various external data sources as their\nmain task. This indicates that having good data\nsecurity governance may be important and essential\nto these organisations. There exists however, challenges faced by these\nSMEs. The lack of understanding on the benefits of\ntechnology and the inability to manage the potential\nuncertainty that may occur when implementing\ntechnology may result in hesitation among these\nSMEs to adopt more advanced data analytics. Given\ntheir limited IT resources and skills, there are also\nconcerns over data security and privacy.  While a data\nanalytics environment was starting to emerge in their\norganisation, the respondents felt that data analytics\nmight not support cross-functional or company-wide\ndecision processes. Hence, a lack of synchronisation\nor a missing systematic data analytical framework\nwithin their organisations is apparent.\nA supporting platform to help SMEs design a data\nframework to ensure seamless analyses flow will\nincrease the chance of realising the business value\nbrought about by data analytics and eventually,\nmonetary benefits for the organisations.These respondents are existing data analytics adopters who believe\nthat data analytics business values can be realised through a good\nsystem design that suits their business structure and model, as well\nas through quality data analytics software that is fit for use.\nSeminars and workshops\non compliance with the\nPersonal Data and\nProtection Act or on the\nuse of advanced data\nanalytics tools will further\nenhance knowledge and\nskills on data analytics.

This\nsuggests that factors other than concerns on the\nimplementation cost are preventing these SMEs from\nadopting data analytics.
