    "Reginald is a professional chemical engineer who specialises in surface science and understands the interfacial interactions of particulates in biological and materials systems. His overarching applied research goal will be to exploit the knowledge gained to design and fabricate novel ‘green’ composite materials for a variety of critical industry relevant applications. These include the areas of bioremediation, catalysis, carbon sequestration, drug delivery, energy, food technologies, water conservation and purification. He holds a US patent on using magnetic pollen grains as sorbents for removal of organic contaminants in water, and his work on particulate removal from surfaces using just water and heat (Leidenfrost effect) was featured in Nature Physics. He teaches in the Chemical Engineering and Food Technology cluster at SIT, and was previously a faculty at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and a visiting assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \nHe holds a Bachelor of Science (Chemical Engineering) from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a Master of Science (Chemical Engineering) and Doctor of Philosophy (Chemical Engineering) from the Georgia Institute of Technology.",
