    "Semiconductor manufacturing poses intricate challenges stemming from its complex processes, machinery, and parameters.",
    "Manufacturing companies often struggle with the early detection of anomalies and optimising process parameters due to the high costs associated with traditional methods like Design of Experiment (DOE). Additionally, inadequate machine maintenance can lead to quality issues and financial losses, exacerbated by existing maintenance routines that may not effectively prevent breakdowns. To address these challenges, the semiconductor manufacturing sector requires Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven solutions.",
    "This course is designed to empower industry professionals with advanced data analytics methodologies in AI and Machine Learning (ML). Through a combination of theoretical exploration, relevant case studies, and hands-on Python programming sessions, learners will develop a deep understanding of AI technologies and their application in semiconductor manufacturing.",
    "By delving into real semiconductor data examples and utilising sample code, learners will gain practical experience in AI data analytics, enabling them to identify and address areas for improvement within their industries. Whether it's enhancing defect detection, optimising process parameters, or implementing predictive maintenance systems, this course equips learners with the tools and knowledge needed to drive meaningful change.",
