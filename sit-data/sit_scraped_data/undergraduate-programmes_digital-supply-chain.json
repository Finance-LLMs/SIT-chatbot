You will learn to integrate theories through practice, acquire industry knowledge and develop professional skills in a real-world environment. IWSP provides an opportunity for students to immerse themselves in the placement company’s business and culture. The practical experience will allow students to smoothly transit into a career upon graduation.",
    "Term-In Term-Out (TITO)",
    "The TITO pathway allows students to alternate their time between the university and the workplace every year. At the end of their full-time undergraduate studies, students on this pathway would have spent extended time learning and immersing in authentic industry settings to gain substantial work experience without prolonging the duration of their degree programme. The TITO pathway exemplifies the foundation of our applied learning pedagogy, which is ‘learning by doing’, and we believe that this will give students a stronger head-start to the working world by exposing them to the latest industry developments, business intricacies and work cultures.",
