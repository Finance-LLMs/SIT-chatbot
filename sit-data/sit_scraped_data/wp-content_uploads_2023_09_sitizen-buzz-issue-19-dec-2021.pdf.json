The new members are:\n•Mr Chan Hian Lim, Deputy Chief Executive Officer (Corporate, Industry and Technology), Singapore Food Agency (appointed on 16\nSeptember 2021).\n•Ms Neo Gim Huay, Managing Director, Climate Change Strategy, Temasek International Pie Ltd (appointed on 16 September 2021).\n•Ms Susan Soh, Co-Head of Asia Pacific, Schroder Investment Management (Singapore) Ltd. (appointed on 16 September 2021).\n•Ms Lim Wan Yong, Second Permanent Secretary (Education), Ministry of Education (appointed on 4 October 2021)\n(From left 10 right): Mr Chan Hian Lim, Ms Neo Gtm Huay, Ms Susan Soh, and Ms Lim Wan Yong.\nAs part of Board renewal, Prof Heng Chye Kiang, Ms Melissa Khoo, and Mr TK Udairam have stepped down from the SIT Board of\nTrustees on the conclusion of their respective terms of appointment. Prof Heng is the Provost Chair Professor, School of Design and\nEnvironment, National University of Singapore; Ms Khoo is the Deputy Secretary (Policy), Ministry of Education; and Mr Udairam is the\nChief Operating Officer, Sheares Healthcare Managemen t Pie Ltd.\nMr Ng Yat Chung, Chairman, Board of Trustees, SIT said, \"We are very pleased to welcome the four new members to our Board of\nTrustees. With their rich experience and expertise, they will bring relevant insights to help shape SIT's educatio n and applied research\nmissions as Singapore's premier University of Applied Learning.\"\n\"At the same time, I would like to thank the three Board Trustees who have stepped down for their dedicated service and contributions\nto SIT during their term. They have provided sound guidance that has helped chart the university's growth,\" said Mr Ng.\nThe full list of Trustees can be found�-\nFor the full story, please go lo SIT's Digital Newsroom:\nhilos;//www.s;n gaporetech.edu,sglgjgitaloewsroom/sjt-welcomes-four-new-members -to-;ts-board-of-trustees/\nSIT Trumps 67 Teams to Win BECC\n2021\nA team of SIT Engineering students won the Built Environment Case Competition 2021 with their proposal of a\nfuturistic floating city\nEl 03 December 2021\nThe SIT team's vision of floating living with hydroponic glasshouses along Singapore's coastline.\nEngineering students Ms Teoh Mei Ting, Mr Ashok Kumar, and Mr Syed Noorhalim bin Abdul Razak started out with a simple goal: enter\nthe Built Environment Case Competition (BECC) 2021 to further their knowledge on tackling climate change and to gain competition\nexperience. Two months spent designing an impressive concept of a futuristic, floating city in Singapore led them far beyond that target -\nthe team emerged as winners of the competition and netted a $1,200 cash prize.\nThe BECC, organised by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Civil Engineering & Environment Club, presents students with a\nproblem faced by industry players of the built environment. Teams must then analyse and propose a solution that employs technology\nand sustainability. This year's edition centred on Singapore's relationship with living on water to tackle climate change and rising sea\nlevels.\nFrom left: The team comprised SIE (BS) students Mr Syed Noorhahm b,n Abdul Razak and Ms Teoh Me, Ting, as well as C1v1l Engineering student Mr Ashok\nKumar.\nThe team, led by Mei Ting (Year 2, Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services)), came up with the proposal for a Very Large\nFloating Structures (VLFS) development plan that involved a future floating city, pillars of sustainability, and feasibility studies. They\nchose the idea of floating structures as these would provide an opportunity for future expansion of land. At the same time, the structures\nwould have the ability lo stay resilient against changing tides and rising sea levels. The VLFS incorporates three system designs that\nwould ensure its liveability:\n•A durable and long-lasting platform design;\n•A hybrid breakwater -wave energy converter system, which provides a 24/7 wave power resource for floating towns, and a\nbreakwater feature of wave energy converters lo reinforce the platform's structural integrity;\n•An adjustable mooring system constructed with winches, a pulley system, and mooring lines. The system is connected to the\nseabed to ensure that the platform does not dislocate due to waves and is elevatable when the sea level rises .\n. ----\n(left) Aquaculture and hydropon,c farms on the floallng platform. waste from aquaculture farms can be used as nutrients for hydroponic farms and plants grown\ncan be used to feed fosh. {right) Containers on the floating platform that are refurbished into office spaces.\n\"This project really showed me the possibility of what it would be like to have a new, exciting, sustainable constructi on engineering\ncareer,\" said Mei Ting. \"Compared lo land reclamation, developing floating cities along the coastline on VLFS could potentially be a fast,\neconomical, and sustainable way lo encounter  rising sea levels whilst protecting our coastline.\"\nFor the full story, please go to SIT's Digital Newsroom: h11os;//www.sin gaporetech.edu.sW,1 igita[newsroom/sjt-t rymps-67-teams-to­\nwjn-becc-2021/"
