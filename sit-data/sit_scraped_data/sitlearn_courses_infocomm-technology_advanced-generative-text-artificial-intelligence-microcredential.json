    "This specialised micro-credential equips learners with in-demand expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on AI-driven text automation, business intelligence, and conversational AI.",
    "Hands-on experience will be gained in developing and optimising NLP and LLM systems, covering key topics such as transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, embeddings, and transfer learning – essential for building scalable solutions like sentiment analysis engines, machine translation systems, chatbots, and automated content generation tools.",
    "The micro-credential combines both theoretical frameworks and practical applications. Learners will develop skills in text preprocessing, tokenisation, embedding techniques, and model evaluation, with a focus on training classification and regression models, applying optimisation strategies, and using industry-standard evaluation metrics. Additionally, the course delves into LLMs, with an emphasis on transformer models and fine-tuning them for real-world applications such as chatbots and generative AI solutions.",
    "Integrating online and in-person delivery, the micro-credential includes activities such as building an NLP application, developing preprocessing pipelines, training and evaluating models, and fine-tuning a GPT model. You will also create runnable notebook code to demonstrate model outputs. By the end, you will be equipped to design and implement practical NLP and LLM solutions for real-world use cases.",
