    "Assistant Professor Lim Wee Han is again honoured with a teaching excellence award that recognises his outstanding teaching and sustained excellence in the development and application of innovative pedagogies in teaching.",
    "He employs a wide range of teaching strategies to successfully engage diverse cohorts of undergraduates in both small and large classes as well as online. His approach has significantly improved the overall student experience and led to quality learning outcomes. By helping students to develop critical thinking skills, providing them with advice and encouraging them when they encounter challenges, as well as getting them to participate in competitions in which prototypes were constructed and prizes won, he is nurturing thinking tinkerers among his students.",
    "(Abstract from citation by Eng evaluation committee member)",
    "Mr Woo Wing Keong",
    "Wing Keong has been regarded by many students as a father figure in terms of their education at SIT. This speaks volumes of his abilities to guide the students through their learning experience and really shows that he genuinely cares for the students’ academic well-being. Being a teacher of high standards, Wing Keong sets a very high bar for himself and his students, consistently challenging the students to push themselves further. Despite this, students would still speak fondly of the way he teaches and would regularly comment on how he makes even the most difficult subject interesting and easier to comprehend. This close student-mentor relationship that Wing Keong has established with the students is not an easy feat and should serve as an inspiration for all teachers in their pursuit of being a role model for our students.",
    "(Abstract from citation by ICT evaluation committee member)",
    "Dr Karin Avnit",
    "Karin has been a champion in teaching innovation at SIT. She has consistently demonstrated that she does not just teach like business-as-usual, but she seeks to find new means to improve her teaching effectiveness so as to maximize the student learning outcomes. Being a trail-blazer is never easy and Karin does not shy away from the challenges in instilling these new pedagogies. For example, she has been a key driver in the implementation of the Team-Based Learning pedagogy at SIT despite the many difficulties that she faced. Being passionate about excellence in teaching, Karin also actively shares her experiences with her peers so that they can collectively enhance the quality of the students’ education at SIT.",
    "(Abstract from citation by ICT evaluation committee member)",
    "Dr Jiow Hee Jhee",
    "Hee Jhee has received unanimous feedback from students, other faculty and industry partners on his excellence in teaching and commitment in students’ development. His approachable, humble and humorous demeanor helps students engage in his teaching. Students commented that he made dry and difficult topics interesting to learn, and his knowledge and enthusiasm brighten up a typically dry module. Hee Jhee connects his research work to students’ learning and has been committed in helping them develop research skills and academic writing in an authentic and fruitful way. He innovates through a work-based learning module, by getting Criminology students to work with non-profit organizations on real projects that are Grounded in the Community.",
    "(Abstract from citation by HSS evaluation committee member)",
    "Dr Leslie Loo",
    "Assoc Prof Leslie Loo is awarded the teaching excellence award for showing great commitment to the students, effective teaching style and innovation in teaching and learning assessment. He has always made time to aid the students in their work and went above and is well- liked by the students. In teaching technical subjects, he has managed to simplify difficult technical content and made class interesting by providing projects and linked theory to practice. Overall, we are happy to recognise him for his efforts.",

    "Dr Ng Lee Keng",
    "For the many modules she taught in AY2015, students gave her evaluation scores of 4.7, 4.8, 4.9….",
    "She describes herself as a boring person, because all her hobbies are teaching-related, be it reading or studying.",
    "She says that there is no shortcut for excellent teaching, just be patient, and be well-prepared.",
    "She comes to school one and half hours before the official starting time and rehearses multiple rounds before each lecture, tutorial, and workshop.",
    "She manages to remember all students’ names after the first tutorial session because she wants to engage her students and let them know that she means to teach them as individuals.",
