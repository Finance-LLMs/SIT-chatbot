    "NASA Astronaut, Jeffrey N. Williams",
    ", who holds the record for the longest time spent in space by an American Male Astronaut. At the Hackathon, he also shared insights on his space missions in a talk on “What It Takes To Be An Astronaut?”",
    "Professor Ng Siu Choon, Associate Provost (Students & Faculty Development), SIT",
    "said, “We are delighted to organise this SIT Hackathon. It encourages SIT undergraduates to think of creative ideas on sustainable living in space using additive manufacturing (AM) technology. By affording a platform for them to present their innovative proposals, we hope to spark an interest among SITizens in technology, as well as Singapore’s budding space scene. The strong nexus of applied learning to research encourages our students to go beyond their curriculum and to think out of the box for solutions that can solve real world problems.”",
    "Associate Professor Lim Tit Ming, Chief Executive, Science Centre Singapore",
    "said, “Hackathons are a great way to strengthen connections, facilitate fruitful exchanges and stimulate creativity. It’s always inspiring to see the younger generation come together to co-create ideas. In this sense, we see hackathons not just as opportunities to generate solutions but to accelerate innovation. That sense of curiosity, enthusiasm and passion among the teams is what we aim to foster. The hackathon also demonstrates the importance of bringing like-minded partners together to create nurturing spaces. All these small steps can lead to giant leaps in overcoming the complex challenges before us.”",
    "Dr Neo Kok Beng, Founder of NEO Aeronautics",
    "said, “I would like to encourage students to apply their scientific knowledge and imagination to explore opportunities in the space industry.”",
    "Some of the ideas presented by the other teams include using material found on the lunar surface to produce building foundations, development of an Advanced Manufacturing and Innovation Capsule that eliminates the need for a space station and a Space Construction Vehicle that recycles space waste into reusable materials.",

    "About NEO Aeronautics",
    "NEO Aeronautics is incorporated in 2018 with the focus to design and produce manned personal aerial vehicle (PAV) that is safe, reliable, and affordable; and to build Urban Aerial Mobility (UAM) communities globally.",
    "Since the company’s inception, we have developed two prototypes, Crimson S8, of the PAV as proof of concept. Covid-19 has slowed down our product development. With the opening of the economy, we are ready to build flight trial and certification version.",
    "Currently, the regulations in Singapore does not allow for personal aerial vehicles to be operated in the open, thus we plan to test and certify the vehicle in the United States. The unmanned version will be tested in Singapore. As the PAV is developed as an “ultralight vehicle” under the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 103 rules, anyone would be able to use it. Under US law, operators of ultralight vehicles do not need a pilot license.",
    "Apart from using it as a personal mode of transport from point to point, we are also plan to roll out the PAVs for the tourism market. We plan to have the vehicle built and tested locally in an unmanned mode in October 2022.  Thereafter, we will test and certify the vehicle in manned mode in United States in early 2023. Our goal is to have 1,000 of our PAVs in 25 cities making 50 million trips yearly.",

    "Sustainability in Space:",
    "Currently, space missions require excess equipment to be prepared for unforeseen circumstances.  When necessary, rockets are launched to transport equipment where requirements are deemed mission critical.  Sometime this leads to waste and inefficiency.  Technology such as 3D printing or smart indoor farming can allow equipment, resources or even food to be produced as needed.  This will help to reduce excess equipment to be transported and reduce the need for additional rocket launches.  Hence, making space activities more sustainable.",

    "REPA",
    "Cooked food is sent up to the International Space Station (ISS) via a spacecraft every 90 days.  This is because cooked food does not have a long shelf life. Along with food, the spacecraft might carry additional items required for logistics or repair work. These items being sent to the ISS require proper packaging to ensure that they are kept safe during the journey. However, should an emergency happen in the ISS where repair parts are needed before the next scheduled spacecraft flight, one will have to be launched immediately. REPA is proposing to 3D print repair parts/components in the ISS, where the filament needed for printing is made from the plastic packaging used to store the items brought from earth. The objective is to reduce the number of spacecraft trips to the ISS or allow spacecraft with smaller payload to be sent instead of the larger one, hence trimming the operational cost. This idea would require two machines to be sent into the ISS, one to shred the plastic packaging and one to produce the components/parts.",

Williams. (SIT Photo: Keng Photography/Wang Zhixiang)\n8 June 2022 – The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), Science Centre Singapore and NEO Aeronautics Pte Ltd successfully concluded the inaugural edition of\n‘The SIT Hackathon 2022: Sustainability in Space’.\nThemed\n‘How to Live in Space for 365 Days’,\nthe Hackathon saw participating students from SIT proposing innovative solutions related to 3D printing technologies that can be used in space. From January 2022 to June 2022, six teams submitted their product proposals and were given a budget of $500 to produce their prototype. Four teams progressed to the Grand Final, held at SIT@Dover on 8 June.\nTeam REPA impressed the judges with their sustainable innovation proposal and clinched the top prize of $500 cash. The winning team, comprising three Year 3 Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering students from SIT-University of Glasgow joint degree programmes, proposed using recyclable plastic material for 3D-printed repair parts in the International Space Station.\nThe event was graced by Guest-of-Honour –\nNASA Astronaut, Jeffrey N. Williams\n, who holds the record for the longest time spent in space by an American Male Astronaut. At the Hackathon, he also shared insights on his space missions in a talk on “What It Takes To Be An Astronaut?”\nProfessor Ng Siu Choon, Associate Provost (Students & Faculty Development), SIT\nsaid, “We are delighted to organise this SIT Hackathon. It encourages SIT undergraduates to think of creative ideas on sustainable living in space using additive manufacturing (AM) technology. By affording a platform for them to present their innovative proposals, we hope to spark an interest among SITizens in technology, as well as Singapore’s budding space scene. The strong nexus of applied learning to research encourages our students to go beyond their curriculum and to think out of the box for solutions that can solve real world problems.”\nAssociate Professor Lim Tit Ming, Chief Executive, Science Centre Singapore\nsaid, “Hackathons are a great way to strengthen connections, facilitate fruitful exchanges and stimulate creativity. It’s always inspiring to see the younger generation come together to co-create ideas. In this sense, we see hackathons not just as opportunities to generate solutions but to accelerate innovation. That sense of curiosity, enthusiasm and passion among the teams is what we aim to foster. The hackathon also demonstrates the importance of bringing like-minded partners together to create nurturing spaces. All these small steps can lead to giant leaps in overcoming the complex challenges before us.”\nDr Neo Kok Beng, Founder of NEO Aeronautics\nsaid, “I would like to encourage students to apply their scientific knowledge and imagination to explore opportunities in the space industry.”\nSome of the ideas presented by the other teams include using material found on the lunar surface to produce building foundations, development of an Advanced Manufacturing and Innovation Capsule that eliminates the need for a space station and a Space Construction Vehicle that recycles space waste into reusable materials.\nMore information about The SIT Hackathon 2022 is detailed in Annex 1 and the full list of winners is in Annex 2 below.\nNASA Astronaut Jeffrey N. Williams sharing with the audience at the seminar.

With a mission to develop individuals and innovate with industry to impact the economy and society in meaningful ways, SIT aims to also be a leader in innovative workplace learning and applied research.\nThe University’s unique pedagogy integrates work and study, embracing authentic learning in a real-world environment through collaborations with key strategic partners. Its focus on applied research with business impact is aimed at helping industry innovate and grow. The University’s centralised campus in Punggol, when ready in 2024, will feature a fit-for-purpose campus within the larger Punggol Digital District, where academia and industry will be tightly integrated with the community.\nFor more information, visit\nwww.SingaporeTech.edu.sg\nAbout NEO Aeronautics\nNEO Aeronautics is incorporated in 2018 with the focus to design and produce manned personal aerial vehicle (PAV) that is safe, reliable, and affordable; and to build Urban Aerial Mobility (UAM) communities globally.\nSince the company’s inception, we have developed two prototypes, Crimson S8, of the PAV as proof of concept. Covid-19 has slowed down our product development. With the opening of the economy, we are ready to build flight trial and certification version.\nCurrently, the regulations in Singapore does not allow for personal aerial vehicles to be operated in the open, thus we plan to test and certify the vehicle in the United States. The unmanned version will be tested in Singapore. As the PAV is developed as an “ultralight vehicle” under the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 103 rules, anyone would be able to use it. Under US law, operators of ultralight vehicles do not need a pilot license.\nApart from using it as a personal mode of transport from point to point, we are also plan to roll out the PAVs for the tourism market. We plan to have the vehicle built and tested locally in an unmanned mode in October 2022.  Thereafter, we will test and certify the vehicle in manned mode in United States in early 2023. Our goal is to have 1,000 of our PAVs in 25 cities making 50 million trips yearly.\nFor more information, please visit\nhttps://www.neo-aeronautics.com/\nAbout Singapore Centre Singapore\nScience Centre Singapore, a non-formal educational institution, and leading regional Science Centre, along with its group of attractions, brings out the wonders of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through its unique blend of exhibitions, educational programmes and events.

Along with food, the spacecraft might carry additional items required for logistics or repair work. These items being sent to the ISS require proper packaging to ensure that they are kept safe during the journey. However, should an emergency happen in the ISS where repair parts are needed before the next scheduled spacecraft flight, one will have to be launched immediately. REPA is proposing to 3D print repair parts/components in the ISS, where the filament needed for printing is made from the plastic packaging used to store the items brought from earth. The objective is to reduce the number of spacecraft trips to the ISS or allow spacecraft with smaller payload to be sent instead of the larger one, hence trimming the operational cost. This idea would require two machines to be sent into the ISS, one to shred the plastic packaging and one to produce the components/parts.\nTeam members:\nTan Lek An Louis, Mechanical Engineering, Year 3\nYeo Jen Yong Bryce, Mechanical Engineering, Year 3\nHeng Hoong Yeow Wesley, Aerospace Engineering, Year 3\n2\nnd\nplace\n($500 cash)\nAMICA\nWith the decommissioning of the ISS approaching, there is a need to re-establish a space station in outer space.
