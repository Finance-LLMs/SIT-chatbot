    "1st confirmed case of COVID-19 in SIT",
    "The Ministry of Health has confirmed that a Year 3 Telematics student, based in SIT@Dover campus, has tested positive for COVID-19 on the afternoon of 20 February. The student has no recent travel history to China, and is linked to ‘Case 82’ in MOH’s case record. He is currently warded at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where he is coping well. We will continue to be in touch with him.",
    "The student was last on campus in the late afternoon on 14 February, and has not come into contact with any other SIT student or staff since the onset of symptoms that night. He alerted us as soon as he learnt that he was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.",
    "Students are currently on their recess week. As a precautionary measure, we have immediately placed students and staff who came into close contact with the affected student, just before the onset of his symptoms, on a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA). We will continue to monitor their health and well-being daily, and render support where necessary. Students on LOA will still be able to continue with their lessons through e-learning.",
    "Earlier today, all lecture theatres, seminar rooms and laboratories used by the Year 3 Telematics cohort has been deep-cleansed and disinfected. Since activation of DORSCON Orange, we have stepped up the frequency of cleaning all campus areas and facilities to up to three times daily, and this will continue.",
    "The health and safety of the SIT community remains our utmost priority. Since the activation of DORSCON Orange we have heightened our precautionary measures. For example:",
    "All staff and students are required to take their temperature twice a day and declare it online if they are on campus;",
    "Temperature screening measures are in place at SIT@Dover, and we comply with the same screening measures at the Polytechnics;",
    "Non-essential mass/group activities have been cancelled, suspended, postponed or otherwise adjusted to minimise risks;",
    "E-learning for class sizes of more than 50 students will commence from 24 February; classes that cannot be moved online (e.g. laboratory sessions) will be broken up into smaller groups.",
    "On an individual level, it is important that each of us does our part in combatting the spread of this virus by practicing good hygiene, monitoring our health regularly and being socially responsible. The well being of our SIT community hinges on each of us staying alert and vigilant to the evolving situation.",

The student has no recent travel history to China, and is linked to ‘Case 82’ in MOH’s case record. He is currently warded at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where he is coping well. We will continue to be in touch with him.\nThe student was last on campus in the late afternoon on 14 February, and has not come into contact with any other SIT student or staff since the onset of symptoms that night. He alerted us as soon as he learnt that he was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.\nStudents are currently on their recess week. As a precautionary measure, we have immediately placed students and staff who came into close contact with the affected student, just before the onset of his symptoms, on a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA). We will continue to monitor their health and well-being daily, and render support where necessary. Students on LOA will still be able to continue with their lessons through e-learning.\nEarlier today, all lecture theatres, seminar rooms and laboratories used by the Year 3 Telematics cohort has been deep-cleansed and disinfected. Since activation of DORSCON Orange, we have stepped up the frequency of cleaning all campus areas and facilities to up to three times daily, and this will continue.\nThe health and safety of the SIT community remains our utmost priority. Since the activation of DORSCON Orange we have heightened our precautionary measures. For example:\nAll staff and students are required to take their temperature twice a day and declare it online if they are on campus;\nTemperature screening measures are in place at SIT@Dover, and we comply with the same screening measures at the Polytechnics;\nNon-essential mass/group activities have been cancelled, suspended, postponed or otherwise adjusted to minimise risks;\nE-learning for class sizes of more than 50 students will commence from 24 February; classes that cannot be moved online (e.g. laboratory sessions) will be broken up into smaller groups.\nOn an individual level, it is important that each of us does our part in combatting the spread of this virus by practicing good hygiene, monitoring our health regularly and being socially responsible. The well being of our SIT community hinges on each of us staying alert and vigilant to the evolving situation.\nDeep cleaning and disinfection of premises at\nSIT@Dover\n:\nTopics\nCampus\nSITizens\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nPress Releases\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nLaunch of Aeronautics and Astronautics 2020 Programme\nview\nNext\nLearning through Play with Lego Mindstorms\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
