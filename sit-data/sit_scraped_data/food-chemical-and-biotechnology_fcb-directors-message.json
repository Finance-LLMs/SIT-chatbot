    "Cluster Director, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology",
    "A very warm welcome to the Food, Chemical and Biochemical (FCB) Cluster — where science connects with purpose, and innovation is inspired by the real world.",
    "As Cluster Director, it is my great pleasure to introduce you to a vibrant community of passionate educators, researchers, and students who are the future of the food, chemical, and (bio)pharmaceutical industries. Whether you’re here to explore food technology, pharmaceutical engineering, or chemical engineering, you’re stepping into a learning environment that’s vibrant, collaborative, and driven by real-world application. Our cluster thrives on applied research and hands-on learning, which is at the heart of what we do.",
    "In the FCB cluster, we believe education should never exist in a vacuum. That’s why our curriculum is designed not only to build strong scientific and engineering foundations, but also to tackle the challenges faced in industries and societies today. Whether it’s sustainable food production, advanced drug manufacturing, or process development and optimisation, our faculty and students work closely with industry partners to translate knowledge into relevant, practical, and impactful outcomes.",
    "We are proud to offer interdisciplinary degree programmes that reflect the evolving landscape of industry needs, from pharmaceutical engineering and food technology to chemical engineering enhanced with Industry 4.0 capabilities. Our applied research ecosystem is dynamic and growing, with projects that span everything from novel food product development to bioprocess innovation. Many of these projects involve students and are in collaboration with industry, offering a unique opportunity for you to work right at the heart of innovation.",
    "What truly makes this cluster special are the passionate educators, dedicated researchers, and students eager to learn, create, and make a difference. We encourage you to ask bold questions, seek innovative solutions, and push the boundaries of what’s possible. Along the way, you gain not only deep technical skills but also the confidence and adaptability needed to thrive in tomorrow’s workforce.",
    "I invite you to explore what the FCB cluster has to offer, whether through our programmes, research initiatives, or collaborations.

    "Welcome to the Food, Chemical and Biotechnology (FCB) cluster at SIT.",
    "Our undergraduate programmes prepare our graduates to be work-ready in four of the key pillars of Singapore’s economy: chemical, energy, pharmaceutical, and food. Our Pharmaceutical Engineering degree is the first degree in Singapore to produce graduates targeted at the pharmaceutical industry. This industry-focused programme is built on an interdisciplinary curriculum that integrates core chemical engineering, life science, and chemistry. Graduates will be trained in the full spectrum of skill sets pertinent to drug manufacturing.",
    "The joint degree programme in Food Technology with Honours, offered by SIT and Massey University, offers a curriculum focused on Food Product Technology while combining food science, food engineering, and food business. The programme aims at educating and equipping our students with the fundamentals of food science and applied food technology skills.",
    "The joint degree programme in Chemical Engineering, offered by SIT and the Technical University of Munich, is the first in Singapore to be imbued with Industry 4.0 topics that are relevant to the current and future needs of the chemical industry. This four-year degree programme will address the growing manpower demands of the local and global chemical industry by producing graduates with deep skills in data engineering and additive manufacturing.",
    "A unique feature of our programmes is our commitment to developing students with the passion to build on their interests and talents to impact society.
