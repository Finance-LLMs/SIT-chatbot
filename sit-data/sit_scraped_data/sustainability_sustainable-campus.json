    "Integrating Sustainability in Our Campus Development",
    "Sustainability was central to the planning of our new Punggol Campus. The campus was designed with eco-friendly features to reduce energy consumption, conserve water and promote biodiversity. We believe that by surrounding ourselves with a sustainable and conducive environment, we enhance the quality of our work and study spaces.",
    "Artist’s impression of Heritage Trail view",
    "Situated by the waterfront, SIT’s Punggol Campus preserves an existing forest along the Heritage Trail, creating a park within the campus. All buildings have been awarded the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark Platinum, reflecting SIT's strong commitment to safeguarding the environment. The campus is home to two Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings, including the food court which features Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) that act as a skylight, allowing natural light to flood the space while generating renewable energy.",
    "Main entrance of Campus Court",
    "In 2022, SIT was awarded the Active Beautiful Clean (ABC) Waters Certified (Gold) Award for our rain harvesting and sustainable stormwater management efforts integrated into our campus. These include features such as bioswales and rain gardens, which not only capture and filter rainwater but also enhance water conservation efforts. Through a comprehensive water management framework, the campus captures rainwater from approximately 40% of its land area, saving about 85,000 cubic metres of non-drinking water annually—enough to fill 34 Olympic-size swimming pools. Green roofs and designed landscaped areas also promote biodiversity and contribute to a healthier urban ecosystem.",

With more than 20,000 Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that collect real-time data on resource usage and occupancy patterns, we gain valuable insights that help set informed goals and drive continual improvements in manpower and resource management.",
