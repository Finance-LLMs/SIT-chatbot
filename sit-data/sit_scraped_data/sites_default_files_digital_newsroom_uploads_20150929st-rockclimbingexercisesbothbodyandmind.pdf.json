Then, Mr Brian Oh was\nmore used to running sprints and\nopen field tackles in the rough and\ntumble of rugby.\nBut the 24-year-old changed tack\nwhen he entered university and\njoined the rock climbing club.\nToday, rock climbing is mostly\nwhat he does. He trains three or\nfour times a \\veek, and each session\ncan stretch for five to seven hours.\nIt was the adrenalin rush that\nmade the difference. \"Rock climbing seemed to be an\nadrenalin-pumping sport. When I\nhad the chance to satisfy my curiosi­\nty, it was indeed so and I \\vas\nhooked,\" said Mr Oh, an engineer­\ning student at the Singapore Insti­\ntute ofTechnology (SIT).\nIt trains the climber in all physical\naspects so he can gain maximum\ncontrol of his body,he added.\nThis is because rock climbing de­\nmands both dynamic and static\nmovements. Performing these\nmoves calls for the person to be in\ncontrol of different muscle\ngroups.\nIt has helped him develop lean\nmuscle, improve agility and strengthen core muscles, leading to\na stronger and less injury-prone\nbody, said Mr Oh.\nBut climbing is not all physical.\nClimbing routes are like a puzzle.\nIt takes patience, strategising and\nSource: The Straits Times© Singapore Press Holdings Limited.\nReproduced with permission.

He also runs Pull your body up with both hands\nand, in one continuous motion, lunge\nupwards and use one hand to grab\nonto a higher sphere. Alternate the\nsequence with your other arm to\nmake your way up the board. Drop\nto improve his cardiovascular fit­\nness and, in turn, his stamina and\nendurance.\n\"Improving my cardiovascular fit­\nness has also allo\\ved me to recover\nquickly between bursts of effort\n¥-'hile climbing,'' he said.\nWhile he has not sustained any\nmajor injuries, he has strained his\nfinger and elbo¥-' due to over-train­\ning and inadequate \\varm-ups.\nMinor injuries, such as skin abra­\nsions and bruises, are part and par­\ncel of climbing, said Mr Oh.\nHis biggest challenge is improv­\ning his flexibility as there are cer­\ntain climbs he is unable to complete\nashe is not limber enough.\nThe most vital part of his\n¥-'arm-up routine is stretching. It\nstarts with basic stretches and flex­\ning of the wrists, fingers, hands,\nforearms, triceps, shoulders, neck,\nback, glutes, thighs and calves.\nHe then proceeds to do travers­\ning on the rock wall, followed by\nmultiple light climbs before tack­\nling more challenging climbs.\nWhile Mr Oh has taken part in\ncompetitions, such as Gravical,\nPumpfest, Bouldermania, Rockmas­\nter and the National Schools Boul­\ndering Championship, he has yet to\nvvin a prize.\nBesides climbing at rock climbing\ngyms here, he has visited such gyms\nin Malaysia and Britain.\nTOTAL BODY WORKOUT\nRock climbing works the entire\nbody, similar to a total body work­\nout, said Assistant Professor Ben­\njamin Soon, ¥-'ho is in charge of a\nnew physiotherapy programme at\nSIT.\nPhysically, climbers need to work\ntheir core muscles to stabilise them­\nselves while pushing or pulling\ntheir bodies up a wall.\nThe climber also needs to be able\nto stretch and move his body, arms\nand legs across the surface of the\nrock wall to reach for a good hold.\nThis helps one increase joint flexi­\nbility and muscle adaptability.\nIn turn, this helps the climber\nwork from unusual climbing angles.\nThe increase in heart and respira­\ntory rates during rock climbing also\ngives the climber a good cardiovas­\ncular workout, said Prof Soon.

This\ntests the power and strength in the\narms, finger flexors and back\nmuscles such as the latissimus dorsi\nor lats.\n2.Training on campus board 2\nStart from a lower rung. Hang onto it\nwith the fingers of both hands. Pull\nup forcefully with both arms and\nreach for the highest rung possible\nwith one hand. Hold briefly, then\nquickly drop back down to the\nstarting rung. Repeat the rnovement\nusing the other arm. Do this five or six\ntimes with each arm. This works the\nfinger flexors, forearm muscles,\nshoulder muscles and the lats. Rest\nUndergraduate\nBrian Oh was\nhooked on rock\nclimbing after\nfeeling the\nadrenalin rush\nof the sport. He\nnow trains three\nor four times\na week with\neach session\nstretching for\nfive to seven\nhours .\nPHOTO, LIM\nYAOHUI FOR THE\nSTRAITS TIMES\nTo prevent injuries, it is essential\nto incorporate movements that are\nused during climbing into a dynam­\nic stretching routine, he said.\nThis can include lunges, high step­\nping, side-stepping, neck rotation,\ntrunk rotation, shoulder rotation,\nwrist rotation, ankle rotation and\nabdominal stretching.\nAlso, do not forget about the fin­\ngers and wrists. Spread the fingers\nout fully and squeeze them into a\nlist a couple oftimes.\nThe main purpose of \\varming up\nis to get the blood pumping around\nthe body and into the muscles that\nwill be used the most, in this case,\nall of them, said Prof Soon.\nStart with an easier climb to pre­\npare the body and mind for the\nharder climb later.\nThe injuries related to rock climb­\ning, if not from falls, are commonly\ndue to over-straining of the joints\nand muscles. An example is when\nyou reach your arm out to hold onto\na ledge. This move raises your\nchance of muscle strains, in particu­\nlar the rotator cuff muscles in the\nshottlder.\nFinger injuries are also common\nin rock climbing when the small liga­\nments and tendons in the fingers\ncannot handle the stress placed on\nthem. Ruptures in the ligaments\nholding the tendons against the fin­\ngers may result, in what is kno\\vn as\ntendon pulley injuries.\nIt is important to understand\nyour body and to allow yourself\ntime to recover after each climb.\nAvoid climbing when you feel\npain as it can be a sign that your\nbody is not ready to undertake the\nchallenge yet, said Prof Soon.\nSeek medical advice from a doctor\nor physiotherapist for your injuries.\nThe sport also includes the men­\ntal challenges of planning the best\napproach to do the climb and the\nuse of good techniques in body posi­\ntioning, balance, foot¥-'ork and\nhand grips, said Prof Soon.\nWhen done right, however, rock\nclimbing can help you reap benefits\nin physical strength and endur­\nance, as well as sharpen your con­\ncentration, analytical thinking\nskills and self-confidence.\nwanching@sph.com.sg for five minutes before performing\nanother set.

Pull your body up halfway\nand hang in mid-air for about five\nseconds. Drop down and relax.\nRepeat the sequence 10 times. This\nexercise increases the endurance\nand strength of the finger flexors,\nbiceps, shoulders and back muscles.\n4.Sitting hamstring stretch\nSit on the floor with both legs\nextended.Bend forward and hold onto your\ntoes with both hands.\nKeep the knees straight at all times.\nStay in this position for eight\nseconds and repeat twice.\nThis stretches the hamstrings and\nback muscles.\n5.Back stretching on all fours\nStart in\na push-up position with arms\napart and the feet close together.\nPush your buttocks up into the air\nwhile keeping your elbows and knees\nstraight.\nKeep your heels as close as possible\nto the ground. Hold this position for\neight seconds and repeat twice. This\nstretches the hamstrings, calf and\nback muscles.But climbing is not all\nphysical. Climbing routes\nare like a puzzle. It takes\npatience, strategising and\non-the-spot decisions to\nuncover the fastest and\neasiest route. The mind\nplays a big role in\novercoming obstacles, for\nexample, when one gets\nstuck in tough spots. The\nclimber has to keep total\ncontrol over his body,\nwhile staying calm enough\nto plot the next move,\nMr Brian Oh said."
