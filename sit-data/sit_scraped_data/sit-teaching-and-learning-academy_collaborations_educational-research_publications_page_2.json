    "Coaching Students in Higher Education: A Solution-Focused Approach to Retention, Performance and Wellbeing",
    "Routledge, 2024",
    "May Sok Mui Lim, Nadya Shaznay Patel, Ramesh Shahdadpuri",
    "This practical guide for educators in higher education encourages readers to ask effective coaching questions and apply relevant coaching techniques to empower and engage students to grow and perform at their best.",
    "Filled with authentic examples and handy tips, the book takes readers from the ‘how to’ of coaching, through the practicalities, challenges and honing of existing skills and new capabilities. The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.",
    "This is a resourceful text for educators, teachers and professionals working in higher education and learning institutions. It provides training material for institutions that want to conduct faculty development programmes to prepare educators for effective coaching conversations in their universities.",

    "Today, “all institutions of higher education almost everywhere in the world have been influenced by the concept of globalisation. The resulting policy changes in each nation-state have, of course, reflected the degree of the impact of globalisation on the country, hence the changes in higher education.” (Banya, 2005, p.147). This points to globalisation shaping knowledge production as well as the spread of intentional and continuous waves of innovation. The effects of globalisation on education can be seen through a) the changing paradigm from a closed system to a more open system, and b) the changing approach from a teacher-centred learning environment to that of a learner-centred environment. This changing approach culminates in the broader ideas of ‘applied learning’ through a) a productive view of learning versus the reproductive view of learning, b) constructivist versus behaviourist, c) learning facilitation versus teaching, and d) process-based assessment versus outcome-based assessment (Rudic, 2016).",

    "CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 2022",
    "Chek Tien Tan, Leon Cewei Foo, Adriel Yeo, Jeannie Su Ann Lee, Edmund Wan, Xiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Megani Rajendran",
    "Navigating large-scale virtual spaces is a major challenge in Virtual Reality (VR) applications due to real-world spatial limitations. Walking-in-place (WIP) locomotion solutions may provide a natural approach for VR use cases that require locomotion to share similar qualities with walking in real-life. However, there is limited knowledge on the range of experiences across common WIP methods to inform the design of usable WIP solutions using consumer-accessible components. This paper contributes to this knowledge via a user study with 40 participants that experienced several easy-to-setup WIP methods in a VR commuting simulation. A nuanced understanding of cybersickness and exertion relationships and walking affordances based on different tracker setups were among the findings derived from a corroborated analysis of think-aloud, interview, and observational data, supplemented with self-reports of VR sickness, presence and flow. Practical design insights were then constructed along the dimensions of cybersickness, affordances, space and user interfaces.",

    "Shi Li Chong, Jun Jie Lim, Teck Sheng Tan, Zi Liang Lam, Jia Yi Lim, Jevan Choo, Moshood Olawale Fadeyi",
    "The human need or quest for comfort and convenience and lack or denial of awareness can contribute to energy wastage. This paper contains a written and video story of a research learning journey designed to develop the educational experience of Year 2 building services engineering students in developing a solution that can potentially be used to reduce the negative effect of human behaviour on energy consumption at Yishun Community Hospital, Singapore. The role of storytelling in developing the students’ critical and reflective thinking needed to induce learning to form an educational experience, i.e., knowledge, understanding, and practical and communication skills, was examined. Students went through classroom training to give them the background knowledge and understanding required to fulfill the energy efficiency innovation project requirements. The reported educational experience gained from the learning journey is documented in this paper. This paper reports a method of developing human capability for energy-efficiency agenda achievement. It also reports an approach for contributing to the educational experience needed to prepare undergraduate students to solve real-life problems and be job ready upon graduation.",

Students were required to learn what it takes to design, construct, and manage a high-rise building's mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems in Singapore and apply the knowledge to solve a design problem. Students interacted with industry professionals with design, construction, and facility management experience to aid their design of MEP systems for a high-rise building in Singapore. Students were equipped with design thinking skills in the design studio. Students got the opportunity to deepen their building information modelling (BIM) software (Revit) skills and used them to develop and present their designs. The students believed the design module learning journey, which emphasised the importance of conducting research for effective design, equipped them with fundamental knowledge and skillset sought after in fresh university graduates. They also believed that the module learning journey allowed them to effectively familiarise themselves with building MEP systems and the Singapore codes and standards for designing the MEP systems.",

The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.\nThis is a resourceful text for educators, teachers and professionals working in higher education and learning institutions. It provides training material for institutions that want to conduct faculty development programmes to prepare educators for effective coaching conversations in their universities.\nVIEW BOOK\nApplied Learning in Higher Education: Perspective, Pedagogy, and Practice\nInforming Science, 2020\nSok Mui Lim, Yong Lim Foo, Han Tong Loh, Xudong Deng\nToday, “all institutions of higher education almost everywhere in the world have been influenced by the concept of globalisation. The resulting policy changes in each nation-state have, of course, reflected the degree of the impact of globalisation on the country, hence the changes in higher education.” (Banya, 2005, p.147). This points to globalisation shaping knowledge production as well as the spread of intentional and continuous waves of innovation. The effects of globalisation on education can be seen through a) the changing paradigm from a closed system to a more open system, and b) the changing approach from a teacher-centred learning environment to that of a learner-centred environment. This changing approach culminates in the broader ideas of ‘applied learning’ through a) a productive view of learning versus the reproductive view of learning, b) constructivist versus behaviourist, c) learning facilitation versus teaching, and d) process-based assessment versus outcome-based assessment (Rudic, 2016).\nVIEW E-BOOK\nVIEW E-BOOK (FOR SIT STAFF ONLY)\nAll Publications\nShowing\n13\n-\n18\nof\n31\nresults\nTake care over sharing: guiding student teams on collaboration\nTimes Higher Education, 2023\nXiao-Feng Kenan Kok\nEffective teamwork requires shared understanding, goals and responsibility over a task. Kenan Kok Xiao-Feng explains how to guide students in working collectively.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nThree steps to accepting failure: recognize, embrace and enculturate\nTimes Higher Education, 2023\nXiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Oran Zane Devilly\nMany fail to see the blood, sweat and tears that often go into both successes and failures. We must learn how to celebrate the process as well as the outcome.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nUnderstanding user experiences across VR walking-in-place locomotion methods\nCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 2022\nChek Tien Tan, Leon Cewei Foo, Adriel Yeo, Jeannie Su Ann Lee, Edmund Wan, Xiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Megani Rajendran\nNavigating large-scale virtual spaces is a major challenge in Virtual Reality (VR) applications due to real-world spatial limitations. Walking-in-place (WIP) locomotion solutions may provide a natural approach for VR use cases that require locomotion to share similar qualities with walking in real-life. However, there is limited knowledge on the range of experiences across common WIP methods to inform the design of usable WIP solutions using consumer-accessible components. This paper contributes to this knowledge via a user study with 40 participants that experienced several easy-to-setup WIP methods in a VR commuting simulation. A nuanced understanding of cybersickness and exertion relationships and walking affordances based on different tracker setups were among the findings derived from a corroborated analysis of think-aloud, interview, and observational data, supplemented with self-reports of VR sickness, presence and flow. Practical design insights were then constructed along the dimensions of cybersickness, affordances, space and user interfaces.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nHuman influence on energy efficiency: A story based on an innovation project with a hospital in Singapore\nISSUU Digital Publishing, 2023\nShi Li Chong, Jun Jie Lim, Teck Sheng Tan, Zi Liang Lam, Jia Yi Lim, Jevan Choo, Moshood Olawale Fadeyi\nThe human need or quest for comfort and convenience and lack or denial of awareness can contribute to energy wastage. This paper contains a written and video story of a research learning journey designed to develop the educational experience of Year 2 building services engineering students in developing a solution that can potentially be used to reduce the negative effect of human behaviour on energy consumption at Yishun Community Hospital, Singapore. The role of storytelling in developing the students’ critical and reflective thinking needed to induce learning to form an educational experience, i.e., knowledge, understanding, and practical and communication skills, was examined. Students went through classroom training to give them the background knowledge and understanding required to fulfill the energy efficiency innovation project requirements. The reported educational experience gained from the learning journey is documented in this paper. This paper reports a method of developing human capability for energy-efficiency agenda achievement. It also reports an approach for contributing to the educational experience needed to prepare undergraduate students to solve real-life problems and be job ready upon graduation.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nHuman influence on water efficiency: A story based on an innovation project with a hospital in Singapore\nISSUU Digital Publishing, 2023\nSharleen Low, Casimir Chian, Zhen Xuan Low, Sherman Low, Tine Nyiyaza, Moshood Olawale Fadeyi\nWater wastage caused by human behaviour can be largely due to human need or quest for comfort and convenience and lack or denial of awareness. Year 2 building services engineering students were tasked to conduct research that will inform the development of a solution that can potentially be used to reduce the negative effect of human behaviour on water consumption at Mouth Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore. The students were also required to write a story and made of video story based on the research to document and demonstrate how the research learning journey has developed their educational experience. The role of storytelling in developing the students’ critical and reflective thinking needed to induce learning to form an educational experience, i.e., knowledge, understanding, and practical and communication skills, was examined. The students developed the background knowledge and understanding required to fulfill the water efficiency innovation project requirement. A method of developing human capability for water-efficiency agenda achievement and providing the educational experience undergraduate students need in their journey to being job ready upon graduation is reported in this paper.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nLearning through interactions with industry professionals for a design assignment\nISSUU Digital Publishing, 2022\nMoshood Olawale Fadeyi\nThis paper documents the effort to inspire Year 2 building services engineering students to develop critical thinking, reflection, technical and communication skills, and knowledge required to be self-learners. Students were required to learn what it takes to design, construct, and manage a high-rise building's mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems in Singapore and apply the knowledge to solve a design problem. Students interacted with industry professionals with design, construction, and facility management experience to aid their design of MEP systems for a high-rise building in Singapore. Students were equipped with design thinking skills in the design studio. Students got the opportunity to deepen their building information modelling (BIM) software (Revit) skills and used them to develop and present their designs. The students believed the design module learning journey, which emphasised the importance of conducting research for effective design, equipped them with fundamental knowledge and skillset sought after in fresh university graduates. They also believed that the module learning journey allowed them to effectively familiarise themselves with building MEP systems and the Singapore codes and standards for designing the MEP systems.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nPrev\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nNext\nLearn More With SIT Teaching and Learning Academy\narrow--right\nEducational Research\nEducational research uses formal approaches to collect, analyse data and share findings.\narrow--right\nContact STLA\nConnect with us to request support for or start a discussion about the teaching practice at SIT.\nAddress\n1 Punggol Coast Road Singapore 828608\nEMAIL:\nSIT-STLA@SingaporeTech.edu.sg\nVisiting SIT\nOur Campus Locations\nAcademic Policies\nPrivacy Policy\nSafety and Health\nSocial Media Guidelines\nTerms of Use\nWhistleblowing\nCopyright ©\n2025\nSingapore Institute of Technology.
