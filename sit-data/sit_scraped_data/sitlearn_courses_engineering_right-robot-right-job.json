    "The combination of robotics automation, artificial intelligence and real-time data analytics is ushering a new era of transformation in workforce transition.",
    "While many existing jobs will disappear due to these technological enhancements, many new jobs will also be created at the same time, and the remaining jobs will undergo some form of transformation. A workforce with strong technological skills, including robot literacy, will have a significant advantage in this new era of Industry 4.0. This workshop will introduce participants to this exciting world of robotics. It aims to equip participants with the fundamental knowledge in robotics such as evolution and future trends, anatomy of robots and performance characteristics of robots. These fundamentals will be crucial in the selection of the right robots for the right tasks. There will also be hands-on experience that will allow participants gain a better appreciation of the contents taught.",
