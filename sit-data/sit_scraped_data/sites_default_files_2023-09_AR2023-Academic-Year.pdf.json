Applicants are evaluated holistically, also taking into account their interests, relevant\nwork experience, and achievements related to their programme of choice. This rigorous selection\nprocess ensures that SIT admits the best fit of students that are passionate about their field of\nstudy, and who can thrive in the University’s distinctive applied learning environment.\nThe AY2022 admissions exercise saw 12,902 applications — a 0.7% increase over the year before.\nIntake increased by 5.7% to 3,121. Over 7,000 assessments were conducted during the exercise\nvia face-to-face synchronous interviews, and/or asynchronous video interviews to facilitate a holistic\nand aptitude-based review of selected applicants.\nAPPLICATION VS INTAKE OVER THE\nLAST THREE ACADEMIC YEARS\nAY2022/23 INTAKE BY\nQUALIFICATIONS\nPolytechnic Diploma\n2,858  students\nGCE A LevelOthers\n205  students58 students\n91.6%6.6%1.8%\nTOTAL\n3,121\nSTUDENTS3000\n0600090001200015000\n11,865\n2,90012,818\n2,95212,902\n3,121\nAY2020/21 AY2021/22 AY2022/23Application\nIntake\nSINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nANNUAL REPORT 202314\nTOTAL MATRICULATED BY ACADEMIC CLUSTER\nIN AY2022/23\nPROFILE OF SITIZENS31.3%16.6%27.4%7.0%\n17.7%Business,\nCommunication and\nDesign\n519  students\n854  students\n217  students553  studentsInfocomm Technology\n978  students\nHealth and Social\nSciencesEngineering\nFood, Chemical and\nBiotechnologyTOTAL\n3,121\nSTUDENTS\nstudents is the first in the family to\ngo to university (defined as those\nwhose parents did not pursue a\nuniversity education)new SITizens to the SIT\nfamily in AY2022/23We welcomed\n3,121\nInfocomm Technology\nis the largest academic\ncluster, admitting followed by\nEngineering at\n31.3 % 27.4 % were polytechnic graduates\nwere the 3 largest programmes,\nadmitting the highest number of\nstudents in the AY2022/23 intake.of students were enrolled into\ntheir first choice of programmes90% Close to91.6 %\nAccountancy Physiotherapy\nInformation and Communications\nTechnology (Information Security)of the\nAY2022/23\nintakeAlmost\n1 out of every 215\nACADEMIC YEAR IN REVIEW"
