The\nStudy Grant, valued at $5,000 each, will\ncover expenses for this programme,\nand at steady state, will benefit at\nleast six undergraduates from the Civil\nEngineering programme annually. The\nOIP , which lasts for three weeks at the\nUofG campus and takes place in the\nsecond year of study, costs between\n$4,500 and $5,000.\nTo encourage excellence among\nstudents from the Civil Engineering\nprogramme, Samwoh Corporation’s\ngift will also make possible the\nSamwoh Corporation Outstanding\nStudent Award in Civil Engineering.\nThis will be awarded each Academic\nYear to a graduating student who has\nnot only excelled academically, but also\nmade contributions beyond academic\nstudies to SIT or the community.In 2014, the company had made possible\nthe Samwoh Corporation Bursary with\nan endowed gift of $200,000. The\nBursary is awarded to three students\nfrom the Sustainable Infrastructure\nEngineering programme, annually and\nin perpetuity, and has benefited four\nstudents so far.\nIn addition to these gifts, Samwoh has\nalso deepened its relationship with SIT\nthrough a Collaborative Agreement\nto establish an Industry Lab (I-Lab),\nwhich leverages off the Samwoh\nInnovation Centre in Kranji. Equipped\nwith state-of-the-art facilities for testing\nand evaluation of civil engineering\nmaterials, the Centre will provide early\nindustry exposure to the incoming\nCivil Engineering undergraduates and\nallow them to deepen their skillsets in\npreparation for employment.Said Mr Eric Soh, CEO of Samwoh\nCorporation, “I strongly believe that\nwe must continue to develop and\nnurture talents, especially the future\ngeneration of engineers if we are to\nmeet the demands of the construction\nindustry and beyond. Through these\nendowments, availing our expertise\nand resources and many more\nemerging collaborations, Samwoh\nhopes to pass on our industry know-\nhow, create a stronger link with the\nacademia and ultimately to inspire and\ngroom a new crop of civil engineers\nwho are passionate, progressive and\nprofessional.”\nThe cheque presentation and the signing\nof the Collaborative Agreement took\nplace at a Civil Engineering Technical\nSeminar on 10 January 2017, which\nwas jointly organised by SIT and\nSamwoh Corporation.
