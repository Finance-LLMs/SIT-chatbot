    "Clinical Reasoning in Assessment and Therapy Planning for Older Persons with Dysphagia – Basic",
    ". Learners must have completed the basic workshop if they choose to attend this workshop.",
    "This workshop focuses on honing speech-language therapists’ clinical reasoning skills through case discussions and simulated patient scenarios, particularly those involving common conditions in older persons.",
    "Learners will demonstrate their skills in dysphagia assessment by engaging in case scenarios and role play. This includes the practice of assessment techniques such as clinical observations, case history interviews, and more in-depth interpretation of instrumental assessments such as videofluoroscopy and fiberoptic endoscopic studies. Through interactive case discussions, learners will also practice integrating information to address how various medical conditions and comorbidities can influence the assessment and management of older persons with dysphagia.",
    "Treatment approaches and interventions will be a key focus, with learners demonstrating their ability to manage dysphagia using various therapeutic strategies and interventions in both case discussions and simulated scenarios. Effective communication skills will be emphasised, particularly in counselling, education, and support related to dysphagia management.",
    "As interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for comprehensive care, learners will participate in simulated team discussions where they will practice communicating important assessment and management issues with other healthcare professionals, such as physicians, nurses, and other allied health professionals.",
    "The workshop will also cover ethical and legal considerations relevant to working with older persons, allowing learners to demonstrate their understanding of these principles through case discussions. It will also focus on developing skills in evidence-based practice, enabling learners to critically evaluate current research and guidelines to ensure informed decision-making and adherence to best practices in geriatric dysphagia.",
