    "5G has been touted as one of the technologies which will enable many new applications beyond cellular applications to support the digital transformation of a variety of industry verticals.",
    "With the allocation of 5G spectrum completed, Singapore embarks on commercial 5G rollout. This intermediate-level course will provide you with the essential knowledge on 5G from foundations, example use cases, various technologies behind, and related tests and measurements for 5G deployments.",
    "The two-day course will first give you an overview of 5G in terms of its key drivers, comparison with existing mobile technologies, example use cases, standardisation activities, and global rollout. It introduces the technologies that enable 5G such as massive MIMO, network densification, and network slicing. In addition, you will learn the various radio technologies, such as active antenna systems, beam-forming, and the challenges and solutions in emerging mmWave technology. Lastly, RF tests and measurements that go into making 5G deployments a reality will be covered.",
