    "Engineering the Future: Giving Students a Head Start in the Corporate World",
    "International design, engineering and advisory company, Aurecon, has forged a thriving partnership with SIT through the Integrated Work Study Programme, reaping the benefits of a robust talent pipeline while helping students gain invaluable industry exposure.",
    "Mr Liak Goh (left standing) and SIT alumni employed by Aurecon (from left) Jarrod Chin, Guo Lingpo, and Shannyn Tay. (Photo: Aurecon)",
    "At a project meeting for a hotel restaurant, an SIT engineering intern confidently fielded clients’ questions about the commercial kitchen’s ventilation, plumbing and fire safety systems. What was more impressive than his technical knowledge was how he had taken on his supervisor’s role when the latter left the company midway during his internship.",
    "Mr Liak Goh, Market Director, Built Environment - Southeast Asia and Technical Director of Singapore Buildings Specialist Services at Aurecon, recounted this story to illustrate why his company continues to partner with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)’s",
    "Integrated Work Study Programme",
    "(IWSP) since 2018. The engineering consultancy firm, best known for designing major infrastructure such as buildings, roads, tunnels, and MRT stations has found SIT’s IWSP invaluable for its staffing needs.",
    "“What differentiates SIT from other education institutes is that they offer the longest internship programme available in the local market,” said Mr Goh.",
    "Most other institutes in Singapore offer shorter attachment periods ranging between 6 and 22 weeks, which inevitably mean lesser exposure to the working world. The longer stint also gives the company and interns enough time to assess their mutual fit.",
    "At Aurecon, interns undergo the same comprehensive onboarding process as full-time employees. This covers health and safety protocols, legal compliance, and corporate ethics. From there, interns join either the mechanical engineering or sustainability consulting teams, where they tackle actual projects alongside senior staff.",
    "“They take on essential project roles beyond administrative duties,” said Mr Goh. SIT interns take on meaningful responsibilities, contributing directly to the company’s projects and success.",
    "This approach has led to some remarkable success stories.",
    "Taking the Lead",
    "The intern who stepped into his supervisor’s shoes for the restaurant project did more than keep things running. Representing Aurecon, he performed detailed calculations independently and collaborated with architects and kitchen designers to present solutions to clients. His colleagues quickly recognised him as an asset and his insights were highly valued during client meetings.",
    "“He was performing at the same level as someone who has graduated and is practising in the industry,” said Mr Goh.",
    "The intern has since completed his IWSP and returned to SIT for his final year of study.",
    "Another standout example is Guo Lingpo, a graduate of SIT’s",
    "Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services)",
    "degree programme, who did his IWSP with Aurecon’s sustainability consultancy team in 2023.",
    "Mr Goh (left) and Lingpo at Aurecon’s office. (Photo: Aurecon)",
    "As part of a small team, he conducted extensive research, making multiple trips to the client’s office. Together, they produced seven comprehensive reports for a project to reduce the global warming impact of a client’s facilities.",
    "“He did the heavy lifting,” said Mr Goh, who was impressed by Lingpo’s professional rigour and eagerness to contribute.",
    "As for Lingpo, the experience proved transformative. “The combination of technical knowledge, hands-on experience, and supportive mentorship has laid a strong foundation for my professional growth,” he said.",
    "The internship also pushed him to take on more than technical work. “I was also given the responsibility to present to the team, which helped build my confidence in communicating technical information effectively,” he said.",
    "Mr Goh was particularly impressed by his attitude throughout the internship. “He was keen, humble, and handled the ambiguity and unknowns that came with consultancy assignments well,” he said.",
    "Not surprisingly, Lingpo’s strong performance landed him a full-time position – he joined the company as a sustainability consultant in January this year. He is one of four SIT graduates who received job offers from Aurecon after their IWSP, since the start of Aurecon’s partnership with SIT’s IWSP.",
    "A Cut Above the Rest",
    "Mr Goh catching up with SITizens at Aurecon’s office. (Photo: Aurecon)",
    "What sets SIT interns apart? Mr Goh points to their exceptional readiness for the corporate world.",
    "At SIT’s Career Nexus, an annual networking event that connects students with industry professionals, Mr Goh recalls being impressed by the students’ professionalism – they were well-dressed, equipped with polished resumes, and asked thoughtful questions about different companies.",
    "Once onboard, SIT interns integrate seamlessly with graduate engineers rather than isolating themselves among fellow interns, said Mr Goh. They also participate enthusiastically in company initiatives, including the staff engagement committee.",
    "However, the transition from school to corporate life is not without its challenges. The structured work environment with regular hours and professional expectations is a significant shift from an academic environment and can be demanding for many students.",
    "“We understand that the first month of corporate life can be challenging for interns. That's why at Aurecon, we complement their work experience with people engagement activities, health and wellness events, and they can choose to volunteer in our office urban farm too. This allows them to develop professionally while pursuing their interests,” noted Mr Goh.",
    "Growing Partnership",
    "Looking ahead, Aurecon is considering expanding its collaboration with SIT.",
    "“We are a multi-disciplinary company, so we are considering taking in more interns from other relevant degree programmes,” said Mr Goh. “We have had a very rewarding experience with SIT, and we are happy to continue this journey to engage a pipeline of professionals in contributing to the industry.”",
    "SIT’s IWSP exemplifies the value of integrating education with industry. By immersing students in real-world environments, the programme equips them with the skills, confidence, and professionalism needed to excel in their careers. At the same time, companies like Aurecon benefit from fresh perspectives and the opportunity to cultivate future talent. In bridging the gap between academia and industry, SIT’s IWSP is not just engineering the future - it’s building a foundation for success for students and corporate partners.",

(Photo: Aurecon)\nAt a project meeting for a hotel restaurant, an SIT engineering intern confidently fielded clients’ questions about the commercial kitchen’s ventilation, plumbing and fire safety systems. What was more impressive than his technical knowledge was how he had taken on his supervisor’s role when the latter left the company midway during his internship.\nMr Liak Goh, Market Director, Built Environment - Southeast Asia and Technical Director of Singapore Buildings Specialist Services at Aurecon, recounted this story to illustrate why his company continues to partner with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)’s\nIntegrated Work Study Programme\n(IWSP) since 2018. The engineering consultancy firm, best known for designing major infrastructure such as buildings, roads, tunnels, and MRT stations has found SIT’s IWSP invaluable for its staffing needs.\n“What differentiates SIT from other education institutes is that they offer the longest internship programme available in the local market,” said Mr Goh.\nMost other institutes in Singapore offer shorter attachment periods ranging between 6 and 22 weeks, which inevitably mean lesser exposure to the working world. The longer stint also gives the company and interns enough time to assess their mutual fit.\nAt Aurecon, interns undergo the same comprehensive onboarding process as full-time employees. This covers health and safety protocols, legal compliance, and corporate ethics. From there, interns join either the mechanical engineering or sustainability consulting teams, where they tackle actual projects alongside senior staff.\n“They take on essential project roles beyond administrative duties,” said Mr Goh. SIT interns take on meaningful responsibilities, contributing directly to the company’s projects and success.\nThis approach has led to some remarkable success stories.\nTaking the Lead\nThe intern who stepped into his supervisor’s shoes for the restaurant project did more than keep things running. Representing Aurecon, he performed detailed calculations independently and collaborated with architects and kitchen designers to present solutions to clients. His colleagues quickly recognised him as an asset and his insights were highly valued during client meetings.\n“He was performing at the same level as someone who has graduated and is practising in the industry,” said Mr Goh.\nThe intern has since completed his IWSP and returned to SIT for his final year of study.\nAnother standout example is Guo Lingpo, a graduate of SIT’s\nSustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services)\ndegree programme, who did his IWSP with Aurecon’s sustainability consultancy team in 2023.\nMr Goh (left) and Lingpo at Aurecon’s office. (Photo: Aurecon)\nAs part of a small team, he conducted extensive research, making multiple trips to the client’s office. Together, they produced seven comprehensive reports for a project to reduce the global warming impact of a client’s facilities.\n“He did the heavy lifting,” said Mr Goh, who was impressed by Lingpo’s professional rigour and eagerness to contribute.\nAs for Lingpo, the experience proved transformative. “The combination of technical knowledge, hands-on experience, and supportive mentorship has laid a strong foundation for my professional growth,” he said.\nThe internship also pushed him to take on more than technical work. “I was also given the responsibility to present to the team, which helped build my confidence in communicating technical information effectively,” he said.\nMr Goh was particularly impressed by his attitude throughout the internship. “He was keen, humble, and handled the ambiguity and unknowns that came with consultancy assignments well,” he said.\nNot surprisingly, Lingpo’s strong performance landed him a full-time position – he joined the company as a sustainability consultant in January this year. He is one of four SIT graduates who received job offers from Aurecon after their IWSP, since the start of Aurecon’s partnership with SIT’s IWSP.\nA Cut Above the Rest\nMr Goh catching up with SITizens at Aurecon’s office. (Photo: Aurecon)\nWhat sets SIT interns apart? Mr Goh points to their exceptional readiness for the corporate world.\nAt SIT’s Career Nexus, an annual networking event that connects students with industry professionals, Mr Goh recalls being impressed by the students’ professionalism – they were well-dressed, equipped with polished resumes, and asked thoughtful questions about different companies.\nOnce onboard, SIT interns integrate seamlessly with graduate engineers rather than isolating themselves among fellow interns, said Mr Goh. They also participate enthusiastically in company initiatives, including the staff engagement committee.\nHowever, the transition from school to corporate life is not without its challenges. The structured work environment with regular hours and professional expectations is a significant shift from an academic environment and can be demanding for many students.\n“We understand that the first month of corporate life can be challenging for interns. That's why at Aurecon, we complement their work experience with people engagement activities, health and wellness events, and they can choose to volunteer in our office urban farm too. This allows them to develop professionally while pursuing their interests,” noted Mr Goh.\nGrowing Partnership\nLooking ahead, Aurecon is considering expanding its collaboration with SIT.\n“We are a multi-disciplinary company, so we are considering taking in more interns from other relevant degree programmes,” said Mr Goh. “We have had a very rewarding experience with SIT, and we are happy to continue this journey to engage a pipeline of professionals in contributing to the industry.”\nSIT’s IWSP exemplifies the value of integrating education with industry. By immersing students in real-world environments, the programme equips them with the skills, confidence, and professionalism needed to excel in their careers. At the same time, companies like Aurecon benefit from fresh perspectives and the opportunity to cultivate future talent. In bridging the gap between academia and industry, SIT’s IWSP is not just engineering the future - it’s building a foundation for success for students and corporate partners.\nTopics\nIntegrated Work Study Programme\nEngineering\nApplied Learning\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nIndustry & Community\nEngineering\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nBeyond the Code: How a Student’s German Work Experience Led to Professional and Personal Growth\nview\nNext\nEngineering a Promising Path Forward\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
