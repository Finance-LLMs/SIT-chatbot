These releases aim to enhance mobile broadband, ultra-reliable low -\nlatency communications (URLLC), and massive machine -type communications (mMTC), for\nwide-ranging applications from autonomous driving, industrial automation, and smart cities.\nTraditional methods of protocol testing can fail to identify complex vulnerabilities due to their\nlimited ability to generate diverse or comprehensive test cases [2]. To address these challenges,\nwe aim to leverage AI -driven fuzzing techniques facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs) [3]\nand the MITRE FiGHT (5G I terative Framework for Hunting Threats) framework [4]. This promises\nto enhance vulnerability detection, optimize protocol performance, and support dynamic\nresource allocation & management in OpenRAN and 5G core network elements.\nThe integration of AI -driven fuzzing techniques + MITRE FiGHT will significantly enhance the\nrobustness and security of 5G and future network protocols [5]. By leveraging AI and LLMs to\ngenerate diverse and comprehensive test cases, this project addresses complex vulnerabilities\nthat traditional methods often miss. This ensures that critical network infrastructures are\nprotected against sophisticated cyber threats, thus enhancing network reliability/performance\nfor applications ranging from autonomous drivi ng, industrial automation, future applications\nsuch as smart cities, and telemedicine. Collaboration with industry leaders such as Viavi, Palo\nAlto, and ITSEC will ensure that project findings contribute to global standards and best\npractices.\n[1]  M. Mahyoub, A. AbdulGhaffar, E.
