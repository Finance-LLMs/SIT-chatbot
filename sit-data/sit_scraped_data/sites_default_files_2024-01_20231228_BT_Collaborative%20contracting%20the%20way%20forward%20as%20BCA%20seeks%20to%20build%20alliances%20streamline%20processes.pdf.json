  "content": "A NEW digital platform has been\nlaunched, which will streamline\nthe regulatory approval process\nfor construction projects and\nstrengthen coordination within the\nbuilt environment industry .\nCalled CoreNet X, the platform\nwas soft-launched on Dec1 8, and is\nexpected to result in a reduction of\naround 20 per cent in the time tak-\nen for projects to obtain approval\nfrom government agencies.\nPrior to this, project parties\nsuch as developers and architects\nprepared and submitted their\nplans separately to different agen-\ncies concurrently . Plans approved\nby one government agency may\nconflict with requirements of an-\nother agency , or result in conflicts\nbetween project parties that would\nneed to be resolved during con-\nstruction.\nProjects submitted under Core-\nNet X, however , will require project\nteams to come together and sub-\nmit one building information mod-\nel (BIM). Agencies will then collec-\ntively review the submission and\nprovide consolidated feedback to\nthe project team.\nBuilding and Construction Au-\nthority (BCA) chief executive offi-cer Kelvin W ong said: “All the dif-\nferent regulatory agencies will be\ninteracting with the project parties\non this one common source of\ntruth.”\nFor W ong, who became CEO of\nBCA in November 2020, enhancing\ncollaboration in the built environ-\nment sector has been a key prior-\nity .\nIn the last two to three years,\nBCA has identified companies that\nare progressive and willing to work\ntogether , to form alliances under\nthe Growth and T ransformation\nScheme.\nThe S$90 million scheme helps\nto bring developers, builders and\nconsultants together to collaborate\nacross multiple projects, build\nstronger relationships and devel-\nop capabilities for the longer term.\nLow margins and short visibility\nof the project pipeline do not al-\nways provide conducive condi-\ntions for contractors to embark on\nmedium to long-term technology\ninvestments, noted W ong.\nHe said: “This is why we are ad-\nvocating an alliance approach.\nThis is so that within each alliance,\nthe parties will agree on what are\nthe medium to long-term capabil-\nities that the alliance wants to\nbuild. This will give all parties a\nhigher level of assurance of busi-ness potential, and clarity of direc-\ntion in terms of capabilities need-\ned.”\n“As developers, consultants and\nbuilders work together , they learn,\nmake mistakes and, for subse-\nquent projects, the same team\nworks together better ,” he added.\nOne such alliance, led by City\nDevelopments Ltd, aims to estab-\nlish a common data environment\nplatform to issue BIM models as\npart of tender documents.\nThis will allow all project stake-\nholders to access the same BIM\nmodel as the single source of truth\nthroughout the project cycle, andfacilitate better collaboration.\nIn October 2023, BCA also\nlaunched the Built Environment\nInnovation Hub, which is envi-\nsioned to be a collaborative space\nwhere industry players can con-\nduct research and develop technol-\nogies to address challenges the in-\ndustry faces.\nFor instance, BCA, in partner-\nship with key collaborators from\nthe National University of Singa-\npore, Singapore Institute of T ech-\nnology , Kajima Corporation and\nSurbana Jurong, are testing a cool-\ning solution to reduce reliance on\nair -conditioning in offices.Beyond such initiatives, W ong\nhopes that developers, contractors\nand other project parties will em-\nbrace the spirit and culture of col-\nlaboration in their construction\nprojects.\nThis approach towards con-\ntracting will involve parties work-\ning together towards shared pro-\nject goals from the start of a pro-\nject, and having structured dispute\navoidance and resolution mecha-\nnisms in place as well as ensuring a\nfair and sustainable allocation of\nrisk.\nAll public-sector projects in Sin-\ngapore are required to adopt the\nPublic Sector Standard Conditions\nof Contract, which already has\nsome elements of collaborative\ncontracting such as allowing for\nthe contract sum to be adjusted up-\nwards or downwards when materi-\nal costs fluctuate, and sharing of\nloss and expenses arising from\npandemic-related events.\nBCA has also introduced an op-\ntion module, or an additional set of\nclauses, which can be adopted by\nproject parties. Those who adopt\nthe clauses must flag early warning\nsigns of issues, and have a syste-\nmatic process to avoid and resolve\ndifferences or disputes.\nMore than1 0 projects, including\nindustrial, healthcare and infras-tructure projects, have been identi-\nfied to pilot collaborative contract-\ning so far .\nAlready , there are encouraging\nsigns that collaborative contract-\ning can reduce costs and comple-\ntion time.\nIn a recent project, contractors\nwere asked to submit two bids –\none following the traditional con-\ntracting approach and another\nbased on a collaborative contract-\ning approach. The average of the\nbid prices for the latter approach\nwas 1 0 per cent lower .\nW ong said: “Collaborative con-\ntracting will involve all parties\nearly in the project, and this leads\nto a better designed and planned\nproject with less wastage and few-\ner delays...\n“They are also encouraged to\npropose value engineering ideas to\ntest on site, resulting in lower alter-\nnative bids.”\nContractors will also not have to\nworry about bearing risks – such as\nescalating worker and material\ncosts – alone as other project par-\nties will share these costs as well.\nW ong said: “Instead of everybo-\ndy trying to protect their own risk,\nthe focus is on executing the pro-\nject well.\n“If there are risks and uncertain-\nties involved, the parties agree to\nshare both the gains and the pains.\nThat’s the way forward that we\nwant to push for .”Collaborative contracting the way forward as\nBCA seeks to build alliances, streamline processes\nNew initiatives include a digital platform to reduce the time taken for projects to obtain approval from government agencies\nIn the last two to three years, BCA has identified companies that\nare progressive and willing to work together, to form alliances under\nthe Growth and Transformation Scheme.
