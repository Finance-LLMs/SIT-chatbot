For example, vita-\nminDpromotesbonehealth,while\nB vitamins help in energy produc-\ntion. Vitamin supplements may\nalso offer those with dietary\nrestrictions or a hectic lifestyle a\nconvenient way to get essential nu-\ntrients.\nBut popping a pill for health\ncould potentially backfire if one is\nnot aware that he or she could be\nconsuming too much of a vitamin.\nThe demand for vitamin supple-\nments in Singapore is projected to\nincrease, with market research\nfirm Euromonitor predicting that\nthe vitamin and dietary supple-\nments industry here will grow\nfrom $581.3 million in 2019 to$737.3 million in 2024.\nCommenting on the trend, Asso-\nciate Professor Claire Louise\nPettitt, from the Health and Social\nSciences cluster at Singapore Insti-\ntute of Technology, says: “With\nlives being generally busier and\nmore stressful, people may have\nless time to prepare meals and\ncook.Theymayassumethattaking\na supplement will give them a safe-\nty net in case their diet isn’t quite\nmeeting their needs.”\nPeoplemayalsobemisguidedin-\nto thinking that they need to take\nvitamin supplements as manufac-\nturers promote them as necessary\n– rather than supplementary – to a\ngood diet, adds Prof Pettitt.\nThe spike in demand has profit-\ned pharmacy chains across Singa-\npore.\nAt Watsons, there has been an\nuptick of 10 to 15 per cent in the\nsales of vitamin supplements in\nthe past two years, says its manag-\ning director Irene Lau.\nA Guardian spokesperson told\nThe Straits Times there has been\nan increase in demand for vitamin\nsupplements over the past two\nyears, without specifying howmuch. During the Covid-19 period,\ntherewasaheighteneddemandfor\nimmunity supplements, such as\nvitamins C and D3, and natural\nsupplements like elderberry.\n“Currently, customers are buying\nmore functional supplements,\nsuch as those for the heart, bone\nand joint health, digestive supple-\nments, and those that support\nrelaxation and sleep,” adds the\nspokesperson.\nBut how do you know if you are\ntaking too much of a vitamin?\nVitamin overdose, also known as\nvitamin toxicity, happens when\nyou consume excessive amounts –\nmore than the daily recommended\namount – of a particular vitamin\nover an extended period of time,\nsay experts.\nProf Pettitt says this can occur if\nyou are taking many different sup-\nplements that contain similar in-\ngredients.\nFor instance, she says if a woman\nis trying to conceive and taking a\nprenatal multivitamin, as well as\nan individual nutrient supplement\nor supplements prescribed by her\nspecialist, she might be overdosing\non certain vitamins.Ms Shirlene Moh, senior dieti-\ntian at Changi General Hospital’s\nDepartment of Dietetics, says\ntaking more than one type of mul-\ntivitamin daily or taking multivita-\nmins that contain large doses of\ncertain vitamins can lead to an\noverdose.\nSome medications contain vita-\nmins, hence taking them in addi-\ntion to dietary supplements can\nlead to an unintentional overdose,\nshe highlights.\nAn example is taking a vitamin\nB12 tablet in addition to a multi-\nvitamin that contains all the 13\nessential vitamins, says Ms Moh.\nSingapore accredited nutrition-\nist Adlyn Farizah says most vita-\nmin supplements contain vitamin\namounts that are close to the\nrecommended dietary allowance\n(RDA), so being unaware of the\ndosage instructions can lead to an\noverdose.\nThe RDA refers to the recom-\nmended daily levels of nutrients to\nmeet the needs of nearly all\nhealthy individuals in a particular\nage and gender group.Are you overdosing\non vitamins?\nAmrita KaurThis could occur if one takes\nmany different supplements\nthat contain similar ingredients\nWith lives being\ngenerally busier\nand more stressful,\npeople may have less\ntime to prepare meals\nand cook. They may\nassume that taking\na supplement will\ngive them a safety\nnet in case their diet\nisn’t quite meeting\ntheir needs.\n”ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR CLAIRE\nLOUISE PETTITT from the Health and\nSocial Sciences cluster at Singapore\nInstitute of Technology on the trend\nof consuming multivitamin\nsupplements\nCONTINUED on C2\nSomemedicationscontainvitamins,\nsotakingtheminadditionto\ndietarysupplementscanleadtoan\nunintentionaloverdose.\nPHOTO:ISTOCKPHOTOPublication: The Straits Times\nDate: 4 Oct 2023\nHeadline: Are you overdosing on\nvitamins?\nVitamin\ntoxicityrare,\nbutnot\nunheardof\nConsuming a diet rich in fortified\nfoods–suchascereals,energybars\nand beverages – containing vita-\nmins can also result in excessive\nvitamin intake, especially if people\nare not aware of the fortification\nlevels, notes Ms Moh.\nFortified foods contain addition-\nal micronutrients, such as vita-\nmins, minerals and essential nu-\ntrients.\nShe illustrates her point with the\nfollowing scenario: “A 250ml cup\nof low-fat milk and one multivita-\nmin tablet for breakfast; a scoop of\nmash potato and salad consisting\nof lettuce, tomato, cucumber, as\nwell as one palm-sized grilled\nchicken and vitamin water for\nlunch; and one bowl of brown rice,\none serving of broccoli and stir-frybeans with tau kwa for dinner.”\nInsuchacase,MsMohsaysthere\nis no need to take the multivitamin\ntablet as there are sufficient vita-\nmins and minerals from natural\nfood sources.\nProf Pettitt says vitamin toxicity\nis generally rare, but not unheard\nof.\nExcess water-soluble vitamins\nare passed out of the body through\nurine. But fat-soluble ones such as\nvitamins A, D, E and K build up in\nfat tissues, hence the effects of an\noverdose are more likely to be felt\nwith fat-soluble vitamins, she\npoints out.\nFor instance, says Ms Adlyn, an\noverdose of vitamin A may cause\nheadaches, vomiting, diarrhoea\nand loss of appetite.\nDuring pregnancy, an excess of\nvitamin A can lead to liver damage\nand birth defects in the unbornchild, notes Prof Pettitt.\nIt is rare to over-consume vita-\nmin D from one’s diet, however, an\nexcess of it from supplements can\ncause issues such as irregular\nheartbeat and organ damage, she\nsays.\nExcessive intake of vitamin E\nover a long period of time may also\naffect blood clotting, leading to\nhaemorrhage or a stroke, she adds.\nAlthough the risk of an overdose\nof water-soluble vitamins is un-\nlikely, regular excess consumption\nof some vitamins, such as vitamin\nC, can lead to side effects such as\nnausea, diarrhoea and stomach\ncramps, says Prof Pettitt.\nMs Chrystal Lee, a 29-year-old\nsales executive, stocked up on vita-\nmin C to build stronger immunity\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic in\n2021.\n“When I started feeling nau-\nseousandhadstomachcramps,my\nfriend, a healthcare professional,\nadvised me to cut back on vitamin\nC supplements since I was main-\ntaining a healthy diet,” she\nsays. While she does not remem-\nber the dosage she was taking, she\nsays her symptoms went away\nafter she reduced her intake.\nAccording to Singapore’s health\nportal HealthHub, the recom-\nmended dietary allowance for vita-\nmin C for adults aged 19 and above\nis 105mg for men and 85mg for\nwomen.\nTaking more than 500mg of vita-\nmin B6 a day can lead to potential-\nly irreversible nerve damage over\ntime,whiletakinglargeamountsof\nvitamin B3, also known as niacin,\nin excess of 2g a day can cause liver\ndamage, highlights Ms Moh.People who take functional sup-\nplements – such as those for the\nheart and bones and ones that sup-\nport immunity – are at risk of an\noverdose if they are taking other\nvitamin supplements at the same\ntime, cautions Ms Adlyn.\n“Functional supplements can\ncontain vitamins, minerals, other\nnutrients, or a combination of\nthem. For example, bone health\nsupplements usually contain calci-\num as well as vitamin D to increase\nthe absorption of calcium,” she\nsays.\nDeath from vitamin overdose is\nan extremely uncommon occur-\nrence, but there have been such\nreports due to people taking mega-\ndoses of certain vitamins, leading\nto complications such as fatal\norgan damage and failure, says Ms\nAdlyn.\nSome vitamins also interact with\nmedications, which can lead to ad-\nverse effects when taken together.\nFor instance, vitamin K works\nagainst warfarin, a blood-thinning\nmedication for people with an in-\ncreased risk of blood clots, says Ms\nAdlyn.\nAs vitamin K is involved in the\nchemical process of forming blood\nclots in the body, taking a vitamin\nK supplement while on warfarin\ncanreducetheefficacyofthemed-\nication, she explains.\nDespite the risks of overdosing\non vitamins, there are certain\ngroups of people who might bene-\nfit from taking supplements.\nProf Pettitt says those with\ncoeliac disease often suffer from\nmicronutrient deficiencies due to\ndamage to the small intestine\nlining, affecting the ability toabsorbnutrients.Coeliacdiseaseis\nan autoimmune and hereditary\ncondition in which the ingestion of\ngluten leads to damage in the small\nintestine.\nThese deficiencies, Ms Adlyn\nsays, are usually determined\nthrough tests by healthcare profes-\nsionals before specific supple-\nments are prescribed.\nPregnant women and mothers\nwho are breastfeeding also require\na higher dose of vitamins and min-\nerals, especially folic acid, known\nasvitaminB9,topreventspinabifi-\nda (a birth defect of the spine) in a\nnewborn, says Ms Moh.\nSome groups of vegetarians, in-\ncluding vegans, especially if they are\npregnant, may also benefit from tak-\ning additional vitamin B12, which is\nimportant for red blood cell produc-\ntion, to maintain healthy nerves and\na healthy brain, she adds.\nExperts say there is no need for\npeople to take multivitamins if\nthey maintain a healthy and\nbalanced diet.\nMs Moh says: “A healthy diet in-\ncludes a variety of whole foods,\nwhich also enhances the enjoy-\nment of eating. It’s also a cheaper\noption and remains the best way to\nobtain essential nutrients for most\npeople, unless one belongs to a\ngroup which needs to take supple-\nments.”\nIf you feel that you are unable to\nmeet the requirements of certain\nnutrients through your diet,\nconsult your family doctor before\ntaking a supplement, advises Ms\nAdlyn.Ms Shirlene Moh,\nsenior dietitian\nat Changi\nGeneral\nHospital’s\nDepartment of\nDietetics, says if\none consumes\nsufficient\nvitamins and\nminerals from\nnatural food\nsources, there is\nno need to take\nmultivitamins.\nPHOTO:\nISTOCKPHOTO\namritak@sph.com.sgFROM C1Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.
