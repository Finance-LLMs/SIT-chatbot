    "Facilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention",
    "Researchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.",
    "The Singapore Stroke Registry reported 9,702 episodes of stroke in 2022, a 52.4 percent jump from the figures reported in 2012. At the same time, the age-standardised mortality rate dropped from 18.5 to 14.2 per 100,000 patients. So, while stroke remains a prevalent concern, patients are increasingly more likely to survive a stroke.",
    "For many stroke survivors, the journey to recovery is tough. Weakened mobility, difficulties with speech and motor skills, and even poor memory retention are among the possible complications survivors face post-stroke. Recovery is also different for each survivor—some can recover in a matter of days, while others might require stroke rehabilitation for years to come. One key challenge that hinders recovery is the patient’s lack of knowledge of post-stroke management.",
    "“Patient education is not always a primary concern in busy tertiary hospitals. Many patients and their informal caregivers aren’t always clear about their condition and how they should manage it at home,” said",
    "Elaine Siow",
    ", an Associate Professor in the Health & Social Sciences cluster at",
    "Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)",
    ".",
    "Associate Professor Elaine Siow’s research interests lie in improving health literacy and promotion, chronic disease management and rehabilitation, and patient care. (Photo: SIT)",
    "Recognising this care gap, Associate Professor Siow wanted to improve how information and materials are delivered to stroke patients. Currently, patient education in community hospitals is delivered through booklets and pamphlets. Associate Professor Siow was interested in finding out whether the use of gamified learning can help improve patients’ knowledge and confidence in caring for themselves.",
    "In collaboration with the stroke care team at Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital, Singapore, Associate Professor Siow led a research group to develop a smartphone app that provides fundamental post-stroke education and self-care measures to patients and their caregivers. The stoke eHealth app features learning resources, daily mood check-ins and helpful games to improve patients’ cognitive skills and medicine adherence.",
    "The stoke eHealth app features various games that are meant to be informative and fun for stroke patients and their caregivers. These screenshots are of the ‘matching pairs’ game. (Photo: SIT)",
    "What makes the",
    "stoke eHealth",
    "app truly unique lies in how it was designed.",
    "“We used a co-design approach which involved patients, caregivers, clinicians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and the app vendor in the initial app development stage. Each party provided ideas as to what the app should contain and how it should be designed. We then let them try the prototype of the stoke eHealth app and gathered their feedback again,” explained Associate Professor Siow, who carried out the research in two phases after the prototype was developed.",
    "In the first phase, the research team conducted qualitative discovery interviews with stroke patients and caregivers. The purpose of this phase was to determine the participants’ perceived needs and evaluate their experience using the stoke eHealth app. The second phase was a pilot study to assess the app’s feasibility in a community hospital setting.",
    "Overall, Associate Professor Siow received positive feedback on the stoke eHealth app from both stroke survivors and informal caregivers who participated in her research. For some of the participants, she observed improved scores in self-efficacy and self-management in terms of knowledge about post-stroke care after they used the app. Additionally, she gained deeper insights into the different needs of this community.",
    "“We found that stroke survivors and caregivers seek different types of information. Stroke survivors tend to prefer topics related to their health and well-being, while caregivers look for resources and services in the community as well as self-help skills to cope with their caregiving role,” she said. “Stroke survivors also feel the need to maintain strong bonds with their loved ones, who often end up as their caregivers.”",
    "Educational content in the stoke eHealth app is organised in a modular format and available in various forms, from self-check questionnaires to trivia quizzes and animated scenarios. (Photo: SIT)",
    "Associate Professor Siow is optimistic about the potential impact of her research and hopes to secure funding to continue refining the app before making it available for public use. She is also keen to create app content in different languages, tailor the content to patients in various recovery stages and expand the app’s use case to patients with other health concerns, such as chronic kidney disease.",
    "“Ultimately, my hope is that patients and caregivers will use this app as part of the recovery journey. The stoke eHealth app could complement existing care practices and help patients cope with recovery at home, once they are discharged from the hospital,” expressed Associate Professor Siow, who is currently spearheading another research project that looks at technology adoption in community hospitals.",
    "An orthopedic nurse by training, she is no stranger to patient care and how hospitals work. Where stroke patients are concerned, she believes that nurses play a big role in helping the patients manage their condition and motivating them to take charge of their own recovery—but with how busy hospitals can get, this role becomes secondary. This prompts Associate Professor Siow to pursue research in electronic health (eHealth) and create patient-centric, technology-driven solutions.",
    "“Technology, gamification and artificial intelligence are gaining popularity in healthcare. There are many ways to try and use technology to complement the way we work as well as improve it, particularly in lean workforces like nursing. The way I see it, technology plays a complementary role to nurses in helping patients recover,” she concluded.",

At the same time, the age-standardised mortality rate dropped from 18.5 to 14.2 per 100,000 patients. So, while stroke remains a prevalent concern, patients are increasingly more likely to survive a stroke.\nFor many stroke survivors, the journey to recovery is tough. Weakened mobility, difficulties with speech and motor skills, and even poor memory retention are among the possible complications survivors face post-stroke. Recovery is also different for each survivor—some can recover in a matter of days, while others might require stroke rehabilitation for years to come. One key challenge that hinders recovery is the patient’s lack of knowledge of post-stroke management.\n“Patient education is not always a primary concern in busy tertiary hospitals. Many patients and their informal caregivers aren’t always clear about their condition and how they should manage it at home,” said\nElaine Siow\n, an Associate Professor in the Health & Social Sciences cluster at\nSingapore Institute of Technology (SIT)\n.\nAssociate Professor Elaine Siow’s research interests lie in improving health literacy and promotion, chronic disease management and rehabilitation, and patient care. (Photo: SIT)\nRecognising this care gap, Associate Professor Siow wanted to improve how information and materials are delivered to stroke patients. Currently, patient education in community hospitals is delivered through booklets and pamphlets. Associate Professor Siow was interested in finding out whether the use of gamified learning can help improve patients’ knowledge and confidence in caring for themselves.\nIn collaboration with the stroke care team at Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital, Singapore, Associate Professor Siow led a research group to develop a smartphone app that provides fundamental post-stroke education and self-care measures to patients and their caregivers. The stoke eHealth app features learning resources, daily mood check-ins and helpful games to improve patients’ cognitive skills and medicine adherence.\nThe stoke eHealth app features various games that are meant to be informative and fun for stroke patients and their caregivers. These screenshots are of the ‘matching pairs’ game. (Photo: SIT)\nWhat makes the\nstoke eHealth\napp truly unique lies in how it was designed.\n“We used a co-design approach which involved patients, caregivers, clinicians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and the app vendor in the initial app development stage. Each party provided ideas as to what the app should contain and how it should be designed. We then let them try the prototype of the stoke eHealth app and gathered their feedback again,” explained Associate Professor Siow, who carried out the research in two phases after the prototype was developed.\nIn the first phase, the research team conducted qualitative discovery interviews with stroke patients and caregivers. The purpose of this phase was to determine the participants’ perceived needs and evaluate their experience using the stoke eHealth app. The second phase was a pilot study to assess the app’s feasibility in a community hospital setting.\nOverall, Associate Professor Siow received positive feedback on the stoke eHealth app from both stroke survivors and informal caregivers who participated in her research. For some of the participants, she observed improved scores in self-efficacy and self-management in terms of knowledge about post-stroke care after they used the app. Additionally, she gained deeper insights into the different needs of this community.\n“We found that stroke survivors and caregivers seek different types of information. Stroke survivors tend to prefer topics related to their health and well-being, while caregivers look for resources and services in the community as well as self-help skills to cope with their caregiving role,” she said. “Stroke survivors also feel the need to maintain strong bonds with their loved ones, who often end up as their caregivers.”\nEducational content in the stoke eHealth app is organised in a modular format and available in various forms, from self-check questionnaires to trivia quizzes and animated scenarios. (Photo: SIT)\nAssociate Professor Siow is optimistic about the potential impact of her research and hopes to secure funding to continue refining the app before making it available for public use. She is also keen to create app content in different languages, tailor the content to patients in various recovery stages and expand the app’s use case to patients with other health concerns, such as chronic kidney disease.\n“Ultimately, my hope is that patients and caregivers will use this app as part of the recovery journey. The stoke eHealth app could complement existing care practices and help patients cope with recovery at home, once they are discharged from the hospital,” expressed Associate Professor Siow, who is currently spearheading another research project that looks at technology adoption in community hospitals.\nAn orthopedic nurse by training, she is no stranger to patient care and how hospitals work. Where stroke patients are concerned, she believes that nurses play a big role in helping the patients manage their condition and motivating them to take charge of their own recovery—but with how busy hospitals can get, this role becomes secondary. This prompts Associate Professor Siow to pursue research in electronic health (eHealth) and create patient-centric, technology-driven solutions.\n“Technology, gamification and artificial intelligence are gaining popularity in healthcare. There are many ways to try and use technology to complement the way we work as well as improve it, particularly in lean workforces like nursing. The way I see it, technology plays a complementary role to nurses in helping patients recover,” she concluded.\nFor more information on the eHealth intervention app for post-stroke care, contact Associate Professor Elaine Siow\nhere\n.\nThis article was first published on\nAsian Scientist\n.\nTopics\nAllied Health\nSIT Expert Spotlight\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nApplied Research & Innovation\nHealth and Social Sciences\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nview\nNext\nLiving Medicine: How Engineered Bacteria Evolved from Combating Amebiasis to Revolutionising Cancer Treatment\nview\nRelated News\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering\n08 Apr 2025\nBridging the Gap Between Theory and Industry\nGloria Kwek, a final-year Electrical Power Engineering student at SIT, began her IWSP journey with the mindset of an intern but emerged feeling like a valued and integral member of the team.\ntag\nEducation"
