Hearing both of their experiences firsthand was brilliant because, as Eleanor Roosevelt said, ‘Learn from the mistakes of others. You can’t live long enough to make them all yourself.’ This session wasn’t just advice; it felt like I got a fast-track look into potential paths and pitfalls, which has made me think much more strategically about my own future.",

He actually reserved a room at his workplace so I could properly present my ideas and talk through the challenges in that formal setting. Getting his feedback in that professional setting was invaluable – he pointed out things I hadn’t considered and suggested concrete improvements that made a real difference to the project’s direction and my confidence in it.",

However, through mentoring sessions, I learnt and appreciated the intersections between our disciplines. I enjoyed interdisciplinary mentoring as it allowed me to think of care plans from the perspectives of a physiotherapist for an example. Additionally, our interdisciplinary conversations emphasized the importance of collaborations and networking to maximise impact of health outcomes and educational research.",
