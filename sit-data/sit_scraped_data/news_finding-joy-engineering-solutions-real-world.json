    "Two SIT Mechanical Engineering graduates share how the Integrated Work Study Programme led them to discover their passion and desired careers.",
    "From left: Fan Phan; Assistant Professor Kyrin Jo Liong, Teaching & Learning Lead, Engineering Cluster, SIT; and Derek Choo at SIT Convocation in October 2024. Asst Prof Liong mentored Derek and Fan and helped them secure their IWSP with HopeTechnik (Photo: Derek Choo and Fan Phan)",
    "We are used to seeing drones soaring through the sky. But how would they navigate the sea?",
    "This was a conundrum Derek Choo grappled with as a",
    "Mechanical Engineering",
    "undergraduate at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). During his internship under SIT’s",
    "Integrated Work Study Programme",
    "(IWSP) in 2023, he had to figure out how to improve aquatic drones’ stability and control. For eight months, he wrestled with variables like waves, water currents, and debris in the water.",
    "Upgrading aquatic drones was just one of the projects Derek, 25, worked on during his 8-month stint with local engineering company Hope Technik. IWSP provides students with the opportunity to engage in industry placements lasting eight to 12 months.",
    "Unlike shorter internships, these extended stints allow students to dip their toes into real-world problems, solving issues clients face and making a tangible difference. As a project engineering intern, Derek learned how to develop and refine solutions to improve the performance of aquatic drones.",
    "“Every challenge pushed us to tweak our algorithms, refine our process, or change components. It was about testing and problem-solving,” he said.",
    "Derek Choo (second from left) with his SIT teammates and professors at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, during a study trip. (Photo: Derek Choo)",
    "This hands-on exposure was exactly what drew Derek to SIT. Through IWSP, he gained a valuable opportunity to learn the ins and outs of the engineering process and develop hands-on skills that could be honed immediately.",
    "Designing Solutions for Clients",
    "Working on real-world projects gives students an understanding of the limitations or boundaries faced beyond the classroom setting. This means they have to examine issues from a client’s perspective to find an effective solution – a valuable experience that students can gain only during an internship.",
    "This was the case for Fan Phan, another SIT Mechanical Engineering student who undertook a design engineering internship at Hope Technik. He worked on the design of portable beds for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).",
    "“The IWSP allows us to get to know how companies work and what they take into consideration. You start to understand why things are done and why you have to take different approaches to different situations,” said the 26-year-old.",
    "During his 8-month stint, Fan designed the structural base for a portable bed that first responders would use during emergencies. These beds would be foldable and stackable, designed to ensure ease of storage. They would also be opened outdoors, which meant that the bed should withstand varying weather conditions. SCDF is currently testing this design internally, and is slated to be rolled out sometime this year.",
    "Fan Phan (standing) conducts a configuration check on an ordnance loader at Hope Technik. (Photo: Fan Phan)",
    "Beyond product design skills, Fan said he learned how to work in a team alongside other engineers, each specialising in a different aspect of the engineering process. This team dynamic presented various challenges for everyone.",
    "“We have to set a clear, defined understanding between our difficulties and project requirements,” he said. “We cannot progress unless everyone has done their part. Like a computer, for example – without electricity, we cannot even test it.”",
    "It also meant that he got to consult various mentors about different problems, as everyone could provide a different perspective. “You can ask around to steal their knowledge,” he joked.",
    "Evolving in Their Roles",
    "Derek and Fan graduated in 2024 and were offered full-time employment at Hope Technik. Derek now works as a project engineer, while Fanis a design engineer.",
    "For Derek, the internship helped him realise that he wanted the breadth a project engineering position would provide. From client management to systems integration, project engineering exposes him to all aspects of engineering as he integrates hardware and software. Fan shared that Derek is “the bridge between mechanical and software engineers”.",
    "As for himself, Fan finds fulfilment in being a design engineer. He gets to exercise creativity and finds joy in optimising his designs with modelling software.",
    "“People think designing is very simple, but there's more to it. There's a lot to take into consideration, and this has taught me to be more focused on the minor details,” he said.",
    "Summing up the impact of IWSP on him, Derek said, “It nurtured me into an engineer that I didn’t even know I could become.”",
    "Samuel Lee, Chief Technical Officer at Hope Technik, said, \"At Hope Technik, we believe in nurturing the next generation of engineers, and our collaboration with SIT through the IWSP has been immensely rewarding. SIT students bring fresh perspectives, strong technical foundations, and a willingness to tackle real-world challenges head-on. The extended duration of the IWSP allows us to mentor and integrate these young talents into our teams effectively, resulting in meaningful outcomes for both the students and our company. We are proud to be part of SIT's commitment to producing industry-ready graduates and look forward to deepening our partnership in the years to come.\"",

Asst Prof Liong mentored Derek and Fan and helped them secure their IWSP with HopeTechnik (Photo: Derek Choo and Fan Phan)\nWe are used to seeing drones soaring through the sky. But how would they navigate the sea?\nThis was a conundrum Derek Choo grappled with as a\nMechanical Engineering\nundergraduate at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). During his internship under SIT’s\nIntegrated Work Study Programme\n(IWSP) in 2023, he had to figure out how to improve aquatic drones’ stability and control. For eight months, he wrestled with variables like waves, water currents, and debris in the water.\nUpgrading aquatic drones was just one of the projects Derek, 25, worked on during his 8-month stint with local engineering company Hope Technik. IWSP provides students with the opportunity to engage in industry placements lasting eight to 12 months.\nUnlike shorter internships, these extended stints allow students to dip their toes into real-world problems, solving issues clients face and making a tangible difference. As a project engineering intern, Derek learned how to develop and refine solutions to improve the performance of aquatic drones.\n“Every challenge pushed us to tweak our algorithms, refine our process, or change components. It was about testing and problem-solving,” he said.\nDerek Choo (second from left) with his SIT teammates and professors at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, during a study trip. (Photo: Derek Choo)\nThis hands-on exposure was exactly what drew Derek to SIT. Through IWSP, he gained a valuable opportunity to learn the ins and outs of the engineering process and develop hands-on skills that could be honed immediately.\nDesigning Solutions for Clients\nWorking on real-world projects gives students an understanding of the limitations or boundaries faced beyond the classroom setting. This means they have to examine issues from a client’s perspective to find an effective solution – a valuable experience that students can gain only during an internship.\nThis was the case for Fan Phan, another SIT Mechanical Engineering student who undertook a design engineering internship at Hope Technik. He worked on the design of portable beds for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).\n“The IWSP allows us to get to know how companies work and what they take into consideration. You start to understand why things are done and why you have to take different approaches to different situations,” said the 26-year-old.\nDuring his 8-month stint, Fan designed the structural base for a portable bed that first responders would use during emergencies. These beds would be foldable and stackable, designed to ensure ease of storage. They would also be opened outdoors, which meant that the bed should withstand varying weather conditions. SCDF is currently testing this design internally, and is slated to be rolled out sometime this year.\nFan Phan (standing) conducts a configuration check on an ordnance loader at Hope Technik. (Photo: Fan Phan)\nBeyond product design skills, Fan said he learned how to work in a team alongside other engineers, each specialising in a different aspect of the engineering process. This team dynamic presented various challenges for everyone.\n“We have to set a clear, defined understanding between our difficulties and project requirements,” he said. “We cannot progress unless everyone has done their part. Like a computer, for example – without electricity, we cannot even test it.”\nIt also meant that he got to consult various mentors about different problems, as everyone could provide a different perspective. “You can ask around to steal their knowledge,” he joked.\nEvolving in Their Roles\nDerek and Fan graduated in 2024 and were offered full-time employment at Hope Technik. Derek now works as a project engineer, while Fanis a design engineer.\nFor Derek, the internship helped him realise that he wanted the breadth a project engineering position would provide. From client management to systems integration, project engineering exposes him to all aspects of engineering as he integrates hardware and software. Fan shared that Derek is “the bridge between mechanical and software engineers”.\nAs for himself, Fan finds fulfilment in being a design engineer. He gets to exercise creativity and finds joy in optimising his designs with modelling software.\n“People think designing is very simple, but there's more to it. There's a lot to take into consideration, and this has taught me to be more focused on the minor details,” he said.\nSumming up the impact of IWSP on him, Derek said, “It nurtured me into an engineer that I didn’t even know I could become.”\nSamuel Lee, Chief Technical Officer at Hope Technik, said, \"At Hope Technik, we believe in nurturing the next generation of engineers, and our collaboration with SIT through the IWSP has been immensely rewarding. SIT students bring fresh perspectives, strong technical foundations, and a willingness to tackle real-world challenges head-on. The extended duration of the IWSP allows us to mentor and integrate these young talents into our teams effectively, resulting in meaningful outcomes for both the students and our company. We are proud to be part of SIT's commitment to producing industry-ready graduates and look forward to deepening our partnership in the years to come.\"\nTopics\nIntegrated Work Study Programme\nMechanical Engineering\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nIndustry & Community\nEngineering\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nSIT Introduces Singapore’s First Competency-Based Undergraduate Engineering Degrees and a Unique Interdisciplinary Business Programme\nview\nNext\nFeeding the Future of Sustainable Airline Catering\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
