    "Off to DigiPen Redmond with a Game Plan",
    "Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation student Hans Ong spent a trimester at the DigiPen Redmond campus as part of his Overseas Immersion Programme (OIP) and not only experienced a different university culture, but also scored eye-opening visits to tech giants Meta, Microsoft and Apple. It's all thanks to his unabashed approach to networking and resolve to make the most of his OIP.",
    "Hans Ong spent a trimester at the DigiPen Redmond campus from May to August 2024 as part of his Overseas Immersion Programme (Photo: Hans Ong)",
    "Even before his plane touched down at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (SEA-TAC), Hans Ong’s head was brimming with ideas on how he would maximise his Overseas Immersion Programme (OIP) experience at the DigiPen Institute of Technology’s US campus in Redmond, Washington. Home to software giants Amazon, Boeing, Google, Microsoft and Nintendo, along with countless other tech companies, the Greater Seattle Area is one of the US’ many vibrant tech hubs. Hans, a second-year SITizen from the",
    "Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation",
    "degree programme",
    ", was not going to let opportunities slide.",
    "Months before his OIP, Hans went on LinkedIn to reach out to DigiPen Redmond alumni to gather tips and insights on what to expect.",
    "He said, “I reached out to probably hundreds of people, and only around 5% replied.” He struck it lucky when he heard back from Jonathan Chen, a DigiPen Singapore alumnus who had also studied at DigiPen Redmond and now works for Meta in the US. Jonathan shared valuable tips on living and studying in Redmond, doled out career and mentorship advice, and even arranged for Hans and his friends to visit Meta’s new campus in Bellevue, Washington.",
    "Networking Gets You Places",
    "During their visit, Hans and his friends witnessed Meta’s cutting-edge projects and state-of-the-art technology. They were allowed to peek into Meta’s labs—after signing non-disclosure agreements and promising not to take any photos or videos—for an exclusive look at how Meta develops its hardware and software.",
    "Hans (2",
    "nd",
    "from left) and his friends at Meta HQ. Jonathan Chen (centre) is an alumnus of DigiPen Redmond working for Meta in the US. (Photo: Hans Ong)",
    "“It was a very cool lab. We saw advancements in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. We saw staff testing Meta Quest (their mixed reality VR headset) and their Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses—it was so exciting!” said Hans. Meeting Jonathan in real life was one of Han’s highlights of the trip. Having already connected with Jonathan over several Zoom calls, Hans had gained valuable insights into life as a DigiPen alumnus working in the US. \"Meeting him in person added a whole new dimension,\" Hans shared. \"It allowed me to dive deeper into what working in big tech is really like. Jonathan shared his daily routine at Meta, how he navigates challenges, and the importance of staying adaptable in a fast-paced environment. It was great meeting a fellow Singaporean and an alumnus who was once in our shoes. Seeing him thrive at Meta was truly inspiring.”",
    "Hans also visited Microsoft after getting invited by a DigiPen Korea alumni he connected with on LinkedIn. (Photo: Hans Ong)",
    "Through other online and offline connections, Hans also visited Microsoft, Nintendo, Apple and SpaceX. For instance, a DigiPen Korea alumni he met on LinkedIn working for Microsoft invited Hans to visit their Redmond campus.",
    "There, Hans not only got a glimpse of iconic pieces of computing history, such as the Apple Macintosh display, but also engaged in discussions with engineers who shared insights into their daily lives and work at Microsoft. \"It was fascinating to hear directly from those shaping the future of technology and see some artefacts displayed at their Bellevue campuses,\" Hans remarked.",
    "Additionally, thanks to an introduction by an SIT alumnus, Hans secured a visit to the Nintendo office in the US, further expanding his understanding of the game development landscape. Although Microsoft and Nintendo are software companies with fewer physical products to ooh and aah over, Hans relished the chance to chat with their engineers and learn more about their work lives. An avid gamer and aspiring game developer, Hans especially enjoyed connecting with the game development engineers from Nintendo over similar interests.",
    "Hans had a go at the Vision Pro when he visited Apple in New York. (Photo: Mark Low |",
    "@markkerokeh",
    ")",
    "As for his visit to Apple, it was serendipitous. A catch up over coffee with an old friend who moved to New York led to an introduction to his professor from New York University. This professor was an ex-Apple engineer who worked on the Vision Pro and offered to arrange for Hans to visit the Apple office. There, he was given the chance to try Apple’s latest hype: the Vision Pro, Apple’s latest spatial computer. Experiencing Apple’s cutting-edge headset was a surreal experience for Hans, who had not been awestruck by technology in a long time.",
    "Looking back at how he managed to score these enriching company visits while on OIP, Hans said, “I’m actually an introvert, but I’d heard people say that you should network. I just wanted to make the most of my US experience, which was why I took the extra initiative to make things happen.”",
    "Getting Creative with Technology",
    "Taking classes at the DigiPen Redmond campus was a wonderful experience, too. With an education culture focusing on hands-on, project-based learning, Hans was encouraged to explore and solve problems independently and often had to exercise creativity, innovation and teamwork to complete the projects well.",
    "“Back in Singapore, we are closely guided on how to solve a problem. At Redmond, we can use any framework or programming language to get the end results. Sometimes, this means trying out a method only to fail and default to the common approach, but I ended up learning more,” shared Hans. Among the standout experiences at DigiPen Redmond was Hans' involvement in a unique project for an artificial intelligence class. He and his team developed a training tool for first-person shooter game enthusiasts. This innovative game helps players improve their aiming skills by adjusting the game's difficulty level in real time based on the player's performance. This means the game becomes more challenging as players improve, making the learning process more engaging and effective. Hans was particularly proud of how this project gave players of all skill levels a tailored training experience, ensuring that each session was as beneficial as possible. Hans was also thrilled that his professors are field experts with separate day jobs, such as his physics lecturer, who is also an astrophysicist focusing on black holes. They brought passion, interesting insights and unique perspectives to their classes, which he appreciated.",
    "Hans and his classmate Mark with Sean Williams (left), a student from DigiPen Redmond, catching up over coffee. (Photo: Hans Ong)",
    "While at DigiPen Redmond, Hans enjoyed getting to know fellow students from different parts of the US, like Sean Williams who hails from San Francisco. Their meetup over coffee was a great opportunity to chat about game development and exchange stories from their hometowns. It was a casual gathering that allowed them to bond over shared interests and get a feel for each other's backgrounds, enhancing Hans' experience and broadening his social circle while studying abroad.",
    "DigiPen Redmond was not Hans’ only university experience while he was there. He also reached out to a Facebook group of Singaporean students and alumni from the University of Washington to ask if he could visit their campus. A student responded and helped to get permission for Hans to visit the university and sit in for computer science lectures. His time there allowed him to experience another rich facet of university life in the US.",
    "Mission Accomplished",
    "Besides visiting tech giants and knuckling down on his projects and assignments, Hans also went on hiking trips with friends and travelled to iconic cities. Conquering the 9km Skyline Trail Loop at Mount Rainier National Park was one of his trip highlights.",
    "It was not all business, as Hans also made trips to Mount Rainier National Park with his friends during his free time. (Photo: Mark Low |",
    "@markkerokeh",
    ")",
    "Witnessing the breathtaking views of wildflower meadows and the rugged terrains of the mountain range, and navigating rocky paths and slippery snowfields at higher altitudes was exhilarating and transformative.",
    "Reflecting on his trimester abroad, Hans is thankful for the opportunity to connect with and learn from experts, experience different cultures and broaden his perspectives. He said, “The OIP has not only refined my career aspirations but also enriched my worldview.”",
    "If his OIP had been a game, it was indeed well played.",

It's all thanks to his unabashed approach to networking and resolve to make the most of his OIP.\nHans Ong spent a trimester at the DigiPen Redmond campus from May to August 2024 as part of his Overseas Immersion Programme (Photo: Hans Ong)\nEven before his plane touched down at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (SEA-TAC), Hans Ong’s head was brimming with ideas on how he would maximise his Overseas Immersion Programme (OIP) experience at the DigiPen Institute of Technology’s US campus in Redmond, Washington. Home to software giants Amazon, Boeing, Google, Microsoft and Nintendo, along with countless other tech companies, the Greater Seattle Area is one of the US’ many vibrant tech hubs. Hans, a second-year SITizen from the\nComputer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation\ndegree programme\n, was not going to let opportunities slide.\nMonths before his OIP, Hans went on LinkedIn to reach out to DigiPen Redmond alumni to gather tips and insights on what to expect.\nHe said, “I reached out to probably hundreds of people, and only around 5% replied.” He struck it lucky when he heard back from Jonathan Chen, a DigiPen Singapore alumnus who had also studied at DigiPen Redmond and now works for Meta in the US. Jonathan shared valuable tips on living and studying in Redmond, doled out career and mentorship advice, and even arranged for Hans and his friends to visit Meta’s new campus in Bellevue, Washington.\nNetworking Gets You Places\nDuring their visit, Hans and his friends witnessed Meta’s cutting-edge projects and state-of-the-art technology. They were allowed to peek into Meta’s labs—after signing non-disclosure agreements and promising not to take any photos or videos—for an exclusive look at how Meta develops its hardware and software.\nHans (2\nnd\nfrom left) and his friends at Meta HQ. Jonathan Chen (centre) is an alumnus of DigiPen Redmond working for Meta in the US. (Photo: Hans Ong)\n“It was a very cool lab. We saw advancements in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. We saw staff testing Meta Quest (their mixed reality VR headset) and their Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses—it was so exciting!” said Hans. Meeting Jonathan in real life was one of Han’s highlights of the trip. Having already connected with Jonathan over several Zoom calls, Hans had gained valuable insights into life as a DigiPen alumnus working in the US. \"Meeting him in person added a whole new dimension,\" Hans shared. \"It allowed me to dive deeper into what working in big tech is really like. Jonathan shared his daily routine at Meta, how he navigates challenges, and the importance of staying adaptable in a fast-paced environment. It was great meeting a fellow Singaporean and an alumnus who was once in our shoes. Seeing him thrive at Meta was truly inspiring.”\nHans also visited Microsoft after getting invited by a DigiPen Korea alumni he connected with on LinkedIn. (Photo: Hans Ong)\nThrough other online and offline connections, Hans also visited Microsoft, Nintendo, Apple and SpaceX. For instance, a DigiPen Korea alumni he met on LinkedIn working for Microsoft invited Hans to visit their Redmond campus.\nThere, Hans not only got a glimpse of iconic pieces of computing history, such as the Apple Macintosh display, but also engaged in discussions with engineers who shared insights into their daily lives and work at Microsoft. \"It was fascinating to hear directly from those shaping the future of technology and see some artefacts displayed at their Bellevue campuses,\" Hans remarked.\nAdditionally, thanks to an introduction by an SIT alumnus, Hans secured a visit to the Nintendo office in the US, further expanding his understanding of the game development landscape. Although Microsoft and Nintendo are software companies with fewer physical products to ooh and aah over, Hans relished the chance to chat with their engineers and learn more about their work lives. An avid gamer and aspiring game developer, Hans especially enjoyed connecting with the game development engineers from Nintendo over similar interests.\nHans had a go at the Vision Pro when he visited Apple in New York. (Photo: Mark Low |\n@markkerokeh\n)\nAs for his visit to Apple, it was serendipitous. A catch up over coffee with an old friend who moved to New York led to an introduction to his professor from New York University. This professor was an ex-Apple engineer who worked on the Vision Pro and offered to arrange for Hans to visit the Apple office. There, he was given the chance to try Apple’s latest hype: the Vision Pro, Apple’s latest spatial computer. Experiencing Apple’s cutting-edge headset was a surreal experience for Hans, who had not been awestruck by technology in a long time.\nLooking back at how he managed to score these enriching company visits while on OIP, Hans said, “I’m actually an introvert, but I’d heard people say that you should network. I just wanted to make the most of my US experience, which was why I took the extra initiative to make things happen.”\nGetting Creative with Technology\nTaking classes at the DigiPen Redmond campus was a wonderful experience, too. With an education culture focusing on hands-on, project-based learning, Hans was encouraged to explore and solve problems independently and often had to exercise creativity, innovation and teamwork to complete the projects well.\n“Back in Singapore, we are closely guided on how to solve a problem. At Redmond, we can use any framework or programming language to get the end results. Sometimes, this means trying out a method only to fail and default to the common approach, but I ended up learning more,” shared Hans. Among the standout experiences at DigiPen Redmond was Hans' involvement in a unique project for an artificial intelligence class. He and his team developed a training tool for first-person shooter game enthusiasts. This innovative game helps players improve their aiming skills by adjusting the game's difficulty level in real time based on the player's performance. This means the game becomes more challenging as players improve, making the learning process more engaging and effective. Hans was particularly proud of how this project gave players of all skill levels a tailored training experience, ensuring that each session was as beneficial as possible. Hans was also thrilled that his professors are field experts with separate day jobs, such as his physics lecturer, who is also an astrophysicist focusing on black holes. They brought passion, interesting insights and unique perspectives to their classes, which he appreciated.\nHans and his classmate Mark with Sean Williams (left), a student from DigiPen Redmond, catching up over coffee. (Photo: Hans Ong)\nWhile at DigiPen Redmond, Hans enjoyed getting to know fellow students from different parts of the US, like Sean Williams who hails from San Francisco. Their meetup over coffee was a great opportunity to chat about game development and exchange stories from their hometowns. It was a casual gathering that allowed them to bond over shared interests and get a feel for each other's backgrounds, enhancing Hans' experience and broadening his social circle while studying abroad.\nDigiPen Redmond was not Hans’ only university experience while he was there. He also reached out to a Facebook group of Singaporean students and alumni from the University of Washington to ask if he could visit their campus. A student responded and helped to get permission for Hans to visit the university and sit in for computer science lectures. His time there allowed him to experience another rich facet of university life in the US.\nMission Accomplished\nBesides visiting tech giants and knuckling down on his projects and assignments, Hans also went on hiking trips with friends and travelled to iconic cities. Conquering the 9km Skyline Trail Loop at Mount Rainier National Park was one of his trip highlights.\nIt was not all business, as Hans also made trips to Mount Rainier National Park with his friends during his free time. (Photo: Mark Low |\n@markkerokeh\n)\nWitnessing the breathtaking views of wildflower meadows and the rugged terrains of the mountain range, and navigating rocky paths and slippery snowfields at higher altitudes was exhilarating and transformative.\nReflecting on his trimester abroad, Hans is thankful for the opportunity to connect with and learn from experts, experience different cultures and broaden his perspectives. He said, “The OIP has not only refined my career aspirations but also enriched my worldview.”\nIf his OIP had been a game, it was indeed well played.\nTopics\nOverseas Immersion Programme\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nInfocomm Technology\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nTechnical Know-How and Resourcefulness Help SITizens Score Personalised Jobs at Weston Robot\nview\nNext\nBridging Innovation and Care: From Adaptive Chairs to Storytelling Tools for Inclusive Learning\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences"
