    "Coaching Students in Higher Education: A Solution-Focused Approach to Retention, Performance and Wellbeing",
    "Routledge, 2024",
    "May Sok Mui Lim, Nadya Shaznay Patel, Ramesh Shahdadpuri",
    "This practical guide for educators in higher education encourages readers to ask effective coaching questions and apply relevant coaching techniques to empower and engage students to grow and perform at their best.",
    "Filled with authentic examples and handy tips, the book takes readers from the ‘how to’ of coaching, through the practicalities, challenges and honing of existing skills and new capabilities. The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.",
    "This is a resourceful text for educators, teachers and professionals working in higher education and learning institutions. It provides training material for institutions that want to conduct faculty development programmes to prepare educators for effective coaching conversations in their universities.",

    "Informing Science, 2020",
    "Sok Mui Lim, Yong Lim Foo, Han Tong Loh, Xudong Deng",
    "Today, “all institutions of higher education almost everywhere in the world have been influenced by the concept of globalisation. The resulting policy changes in each nation-state have, of course, reflected the degree of the impact of globalisation on the country, hence the changes in higher education.” (Banya, 2005, p.147). This points to globalisation shaping knowledge production as well as the spread of intentional and continuous waves of innovation. The effects of globalisation on education can be seen through a) the changing paradigm from a closed system to a more open system, and b) the changing approach from a teacher-centred learning environment to that of a learner-centred environment. This changing approach culminates in the broader ideas of ‘applied learning’ through a) a productive view of learning versus the reproductive view of learning, b) constructivist versus behaviourist, c) learning facilitation versus teaching, and d) process-based assessment versus outcome-based assessment (Rudic, 2016).",

    "Society for Simulation in Healthcare, 2021",
    "Chi Ngai Lo, Tarek Abdelkader, Yik Ming Choi, Anthony James Goff, Suresh Krishnasamy, Guiller Augustin Cea Carpio, Benjamin Soon",
    "Education research explains how healthcare professional training could be more efficient and effective by integrating simulation technology. Despite its relevance in training medical students, the evidence of its effectiveness in the manual skill training of physiotherapy students remains limited. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 3-dimensional (3D) images of real objects produced by photogrammetry and traditional 2-dimensional (2D) images when introducing manual therapy skills to undergraduate physiotherapy students via an online course.",

    "Engage Industry Guest Speakers to Enhance Applied Learning: A Cross-Disciplinary Case Study",
    "The Asian Conference on Education (ACE), 2018",
    "Zhaoping Liu, Sok Mui Lim, Bee Gim Lim, Alfred Tan, Indriyati Atmosukarto",
    "Inviting industry guest speakers has become a very effective way of bridging the gap between academic institutions and industry and enhancing applied learning (Davis, 2009; Feng, Chiang, Su, & Yang, 2015). Different parties including students, teachers, universities and industry practitioners can all benefit from guest speaker events. For example, guest speakers can enrich students’ classroom experience (Lowman, 1995) and help students to realize career opportunities (Metrejean et al., 2015). However, most studies focused on one guest speaker or guest speaker events of one programme. By interviewing academic scholars across different disciplines of a higher educational institution in Singapore, the investigators aim to identify the common patterns of informants’ best practices in engaging guest speakers. Interviewing students sitting in those guest speaker sessions can help to triangulate the findings. Another major objective of this study is to explore innovative ways of incorporating guest speaker sessions into curricula and evaluate the effectiveness of those new methods. Theoretically, this study will contribute to applied learning through exploring innovative ways of engaging industry guest speakers and providing valuable pedagogical aids to the academic community. The promotion and dissemination of guest speaker engagement can also expand universities’ scholar work in learning and teaching modalities. Practically, the formation of a standard procedure and a flow chart of engaging guest speakers will provide supplementary documents facilitating teachers’ engagement of industry practitioners. The findings of this study will also provide innovative solutions to connect students with industry professionals and expand universities’ network of expertise.",

    "Early Prediction of Students' Mathematics Performance",

    "Rui Zhen Tan, Peng Cheng Wang, Wee Han Lim, Soh Hwi Catherine Ong, Karin Avnit",
    "Early prediction of students' performance is important in identification and providing remedial help to academically weaker students. At the Singapore Institute of Technology, an online learning platform in Mathematics is available to the students three months before official classes start. Through the online platform, students will learn and recall the fundamental mathematical knowledge needed for their Mathematics courses. There are also tests that students take before reviewing the online materials (pre-test), after reviewing each topic (topical tests) and after reviewing all the materials (post-test). Here, we report that the topical tests and post-test scores from the online platform are predictive of students' performances in their first year Mathematics courses.",

    "Eight tips for inclusion of persons with disabilities as standardised patients",
    "The Asian Pacific Scholar, 2020",
    "Sok Mui Lim, Zi An Galvyn Goh, Bhing Leet Tan",
    "The use of standardised patients has become integral in the contemporary healthcare and medical education sector, with ongoing discussion on exploring ways to improve existing standardised patient programs. One potentially untapped group in society that may contribute to such programs are persons with disabilities. Persons with disabilities have journeyed through the healthcare system, from injury to post-rehabilitation, and can provide inputs based on their experiences beyond their conditions. This paper draws on our experiences gained from a two-phase experiential learning research project that involved occupational therapy students learning from persons with disabilities. This paper aims to provide eight highly feasible, systematic tips to involve persons with disabilities as standardised patients for assessments and practical lessons. We highlight the importance of considering persons with disabilities when they are in their role of standardised patients as paid co-workers rather than volunteers or patients. This partnership between persons with disabilities and educators should be viewed as a reciprocally beneficial one whereby the university and the disability community learn from one another.",

The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.\nThis is a resourceful text for educators, teachers and professionals working in higher education and learning institutions. It provides training material for institutions that want to conduct faculty development programmes to prepare educators for effective coaching conversations in their universities.\nVIEW BOOK\nApplied Learning in Higher Education: Perspective, Pedagogy, and Practice\nInforming Science, 2020\nSok Mui Lim, Yong Lim Foo, Han Tong Loh, Xudong Deng\nToday, “all institutions of higher education almost everywhere in the world have been influenced by the concept of globalisation. The resulting policy changes in each nation-state have, of course, reflected the degree of the impact of globalisation on the country, hence the changes in higher education.” (Banya, 2005, p.147). This points to globalisation shaping knowledge production as well as the spread of intentional and continuous waves of innovation. The effects of globalisation on education can be seen through a) the changing paradigm from a closed system to a more open system, and b) the changing approach from a teacher-centred learning environment to that of a learner-centred environment. This changing approach culminates in the broader ideas of ‘applied learning’ through a) a productive view of learning versus the reproductive view of learning, b) constructivist versus behaviourist, c) learning facilitation versus teaching, and d) process-based assessment versus outcome-based assessment (Rudic, 2016).\nVIEW E-BOOK\nVIEW E-BOOK (FOR SIT STAFF ONLY)\nAll Publications\nShowing\n25\n-\n30\nof\n31\nresults\nTeaching Physiotherapy Students Physical Examination Skills by Using Photogrammetry\nSociety for Simulation in Healthcare, 2021\nChi Ngai Lo, Tarek Abdelkader, Yik Ming Choi, Anthony James Goff, Suresh Krishnasamy, Guiller Augustin Cea Carpio, Benjamin Soon\nEducation research explains how healthcare professional training could be more efficient and effective by integrating simulation technology. Despite its relevance in training medical students, the evidence of its effectiveness in the manual skill training of physiotherapy students remains limited. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 3-dimensional (3D) images of real objects produced by photogrammetry and traditional 2-dimensional (2D) images when introducing manual therapy skills to undergraduate physiotherapy students via an online course.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nEngage Industry Guest Speakers to Enhance Applied Learning: A Cross-Disciplinary Case Study\nThe Asian Conference on Education (ACE), 2018\nZhaoping Liu, Sok Mui Lim, Bee Gim Lim, Alfred Tan, Indriyati Atmosukarto\nInviting industry guest speakers has become a very effective way of bridging the gap between academic institutions and industry and enhancing applied learning (Davis, 2009; Feng, Chiang, Su, & Yang, 2015). Different parties including students, teachers, universities and industry practitioners can all benefit from guest speaker events. For example, guest speakers can enrich students’ classroom experience (Lowman, 1995) and help students to realize career opportunities (Metrejean et al., 2015). However, most studies focused on one guest speaker or guest speaker events of one programme. By interviewing academic scholars across different disciplines of a higher educational institution in Singapore, the investigators aim to identify the common patterns of informants’ best practices in engaging guest speakers. Interviewing students sitting in those guest speaker sessions can help to triangulate the findings. Another major objective of this study is to explore innovative ways of incorporating guest speaker sessions into curricula and evaluate the effectiveness of those new methods. Theoretically, this study will contribute to applied learning through exploring innovative ways of engaging industry guest speakers and providing valuable pedagogical aids to the academic community. The promotion and dissemination of guest speaker engagement can also expand universities’ scholar work in learning and teaching modalities. Practically, the formation of a standard procedure and a flow chart of engaging guest speakers will provide supplementary documents facilitating teachers’ engagement of industry practitioners. The findings of this study will also provide innovative solutions to connect students with industry professionals and expand universities’ network of expertise.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nEarly Prediction of Students' Mathematics Performance\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 2018\nRui Zhen Tan, Peng Cheng Wang, Wee Han Lim, Soh Hwi Catherine Ong, Karin Avnit\nEarly prediction of students' performance is important in identification and providing remedial help to academically weaker students. At the Singapore Institute of Technology, an online learning platform in Mathematics is available to the students three months before official classes start. Through the online platform, students will learn and recall the fundamental mathematical knowledge needed for their Mathematics courses. There are also tests that students take before reviewing the online materials (pre-test), after reviewing each topic (topical tests) and after reviewing all the materials (post-test). Here, we report that the topical tests and post-test scores from the online platform are predictive of students' performances in their first year Mathematics courses.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nEight tips for inclusion of persons with disabilities as standardised patients\nThe Asian Pacific Scholar, 2020\nSok Mui Lim, Zi An Galvyn Goh, Bhing Leet Tan\nThe use of standardised patients has become integral in the contemporary healthcare and medical education sector, with ongoing discussion on exploring ways to improve existing standardised patient programs. One potentially untapped group in society that may contribute to such programs are persons with disabilities. Persons with disabilities have journeyed through the healthcare system, from injury to post-rehabilitation, and can provide inputs based on their experiences beyond their conditions. This paper draws on our experiences gained from a two-phase experiential learning research project that involved occupational therapy students learning from persons with disabilities. This paper aims to provide eight highly feasible, systematic tips to involve persons with disabilities as standardised patients for assessments and practical lessons. We highlight the importance of considering persons with disabilities when they are in their role of standardised patients as paid co-workers rather than volunteers or patients. This partnership between persons with disabilities and educators should be viewed as a reciprocally beneficial one whereby the university and the disability community learn from one another.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nIntegrated Work Study Program: Students' Growth Mindset and Perception of Change in Work-Related Skills\nInternational Journal of Work-Integrated Learning, 2020\nSok Mui Lim, Yong Lim Foo, May-Fung Yeo, Yu Xian Chelsea Chan, Han Tong Loh\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate students' perception of growth in the area of work-related skills through their participation in an integrated work study programme (IWSP). In Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), 368 students across a range of six programs took part in an IWSP lasting six to twelve months. Students reported self-perceived improvements after IWSP in their work-related skills, encompassed by six domains.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nEvaluation of Engagement in Learning within Active Learning Classrooms: Does Novelty Make a Difference?\nJournal of Learning Spaces, 2019\nSok Mui Lim, Guiller Augustin Cea Carpio, Chee Ming Ong\nThis cross-sectional study examines students' and faculty members' perceptions on their use of active learning classrooms in a university in Singapore. The study targets students (398) and faculty (6) who use active learning classrooms—Applied and Collaborative Learning Environment (ACE) rooms. It investigated whether novelty to the learning environment plays a part in the perceptions and experiences of the rooms.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nPrev\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nNext\nLearn More With SIT Teaching and Learning Academy\narrow--right\nEducational Research\nEducational research uses formal approaches to collect, analyse data and share findings.\narrow--right\nContact STLA\nConnect with us to request support for or start a discussion about the teaching practice at SIT.\nAddress\n1 Punggol Coast Road Singapore 828608\nEMAIL:\nSIT-STLA@SingaporeTech.edu.sg\nVisiting SIT\nOur Campus Locations\nAcademic Policies\nPrivacy Policy\nSafety and Health\nSocial Media Guidelines\nTerms of Use\nWhistleblowing\nCopyright ©\n2025\nSingapore Institute of Technology.
