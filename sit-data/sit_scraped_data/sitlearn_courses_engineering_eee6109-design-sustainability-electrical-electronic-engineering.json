    "Electrical energy plays a vital role in our daily lives and in businesses. Power losses, heat generation, cooling, and energy efficiency are essential parts of any electrical system.",
    "As research and development progresses, including the creation of new designs for industrial products, there's a growing focus on minimising power losses to boost energy efficiency. This approach aims to reduce the need for cooling and ultimately leads to energy savings.",
    "This course aims to equip participants with the basic knowledge of energy consumption in electrical form through real-time examples of various domestic and industrial applications. Concepts and mathematical explanations of power losses, energy efficiency, life cycle costs, heat generation, thermal stability, and cooling will be introduced in this module. Adoption of new technologies and their operation for reduced power losses through design will be explained with various examples.",
    "A significant portion of domestic and industrial applications is covered by motor drive systems, which consume a considerable amount of electrical energy. The course will delve into the roles of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), power electronics, motor drives, modulation and control, and magnetics. Additionally, case studies involving fans, pumps, compressors, air-conditioners, variable speed drives, and lighting loads will be examined.",
    "Through this course, participants will gain a deeper understanding of sustainable design principles, with a focus on improving energy efficiency.",
