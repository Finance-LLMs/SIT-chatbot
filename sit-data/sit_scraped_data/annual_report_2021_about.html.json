    "WE ARE SIT",
    "The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is Singapore’s University of Applied Learning. SIT’s vision is to be a leader in innovative learning by integrating learning, industry, and community.",
    "Our Unique Pedagogy:",
    "Applied Learning",
    "Since its incorporation in 2009, SIT has been offering applied degree programmes targeted at growth sectors of the economy with a unique pedagogy that integrates work and study. SIT aims to provide diverse pathways and skill sets to prepare students for the disruptive future. Its applied learning model allows students to spend part of their curriculum time in work-study or industry placements.",
    "Built upon a solid foundation of industry collaborations, SIT’s curriculum is designed to enhance students’ industry-readiness. Its signature Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) exemplifies the best of university-industry collaboration. Students are immersed in the real working world for up to 12 months, allowing them to gain practical job skills and be work-ready.",
    "Applied Research",
    "Applied research is woven into students’ applied learning experience, where they work on real industry problems and create solutions to meet industry needs. By working closely with the industry, students gain insights and emerge as deep specialists in their chosen fields.",
    "Work-Learn Continuum",
    "SIT strives to strengthen its applied learning focus to prepare students to not only be work-ready, but also understand the importance of learning throughout their working lives. By blurring the boundary between formal and lifelong education, SIT is moving towards a work-learn continuum for life and a greater emphasis on skills needed by industry. Once students enter SIT, they embark on their lifelong journey to learn, unlearn, and relearn, so that they are equipped with skills to prepare for the future.",
