    "Stuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship",
    "CIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game and shares her culinary journey and experience of crafting the winning dish.",
    "One might picture intense athletes or chess grandmasters at the mention of \"world champion.\" But in a delightful twist, Bernadette Rozario, a Class of 2017 Culinary Institute of America (CIA), Singapore graduate and a sous-chef at Claudine Singapore, has claimed a unique title: the first-ever Stuffed Cabbage World Champion in France. With her thoughtful technique and deep respect for heritage, Bernadette breathed new life into the time-honoured dish — typically a medley of cabbage, meat, and vegetables.",
    "Food As An Emotional Connection",
    "For Bernadette, the win was an unexpected achievement. Among the 110 chefs and charcutiers from around the world who presented their Stuffed Cabbage (or Chou Farci in French) recipes during the international selections, only five candidates earned a spot in the grand finale on 18 November 2024. Of the competitors she had to battle was a chef at the Élysée Palace, the residence of the French President.",
    "After an intense 3.5-hour competition, Bernadette triumphed, winning the coveted trophy. \"It was my first-ever competition and it was overseas, so there were a lot of unknowns. The biggest challenge was staying calm and open-minded in an unfamiliar environment. The competitors were incredibly talented, and the judges were top-notch, so the pressure was high!\" she shared.",
    "All smiles for Bernadette Rozario (left) with her trophy in hand. (Photo: Bernardaud)",
    "Bernadette’s love for cooking started early, sparked by watching her family’s domestic helper prepare meals that brought people together. “Food always had a special place in my life. Watching how it brought people together resonated with me. It wasn’t just about feeding people; it was about creating an emotional connection through the meals you serve,\" she shared. It was this very moment that nurtured the first seeds of her culinary ambitions.",
    "Bernadette’s culinary career took off at French brasserie Claudine, where she started as a Chef de Partie (Station Chef) and worked her way up to sous-chef (Deputy Head Chef). The path to her current position was marked by challenges. However, with perseverance and support from mentors and colleagues, she developed the leadership skills and technical expertise needed to thrive in a fast-paced, high-pressure kitchen environment.",
    "In an industry dominated by men, she has remained focused on her craft and refuses to let gender define her path. She shared, “I don’t walk into a kitchen thinking about whether I’m a woman in a male-dominated space. I walk in ready to prove that anyone with dedication and talent can succeed.”",
    "Leading up to the competition, Bernadette spent six weeks practising and perfecting her dish. While the dish, which is a symbol of French home-cooking, was a staple at Claudine, the focus was on refining the flavours and ensuring flawless execution. With just 3.5 hours to prepare the dish, including making a jus, she emphasised precision, consistency, and meticulous attention to detail in her preparations.",
    "You may have a taste of Bernadette's winning dish at Claudine. (Photo: Bernerdaud)",
    "The Winning Dish: A Plate of Tradition and Innovation",
    "The recipe was originally created by three-Michelin-starred chef Julien Royer, owner of Claudine, who drew inspiration from his mother’s recipe. It was a dish that captured the essence of comfort and home-cooked flavours. \"We took her recipe and refined it, adding a luxurious twist with foie gras! What makes it special is how we’ve maintained the authenticity of the original while adding a touch of sophistication,\" Bernadette elaborated.",
    "Bernadette credits her education at SIT and CIA Singapore for providing both the technical knowledge and the resilience needed to succeed in the culinary world. The hands-on curriculum played a pivotal role in shaping her journey, particularly her internship at Primo Restaurant in Maine, USA. There, she gained valuable experience, honed her techniques, and adapted to different culinary cultures, all of which helped her build the versatility needed for international competition.",
    "“SIT’s applied learning approach ensured that I wasn’t just learning about food in theory. I was constantly refining my basic techniques, developing precision, and understanding the discipline required to work in a kitchen.”",
    "Though she has no immediate plans to compete again, Bernadette remains committed to growing with Claudine and continuing to hone her skills. She hopes her achievement will inspire others to pursue their passions and challenge themselves. “I want this win to inspire others to push themselves and pursue their passions. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next.”",

With her thoughtful technique and deep respect for heritage, Bernadette breathed new life into the time-honoured dish — typically a medley of cabbage, meat, and vegetables.\nFood As An Emotional Connection\nFor Bernadette, the win was an unexpected achievement. Among the 110 chefs and charcutiers from around the world who presented their Stuffed Cabbage (or Chou Farci in French) recipes during the international selections, only five candidates earned a spot in the grand finale on 18 November 2024. Of the competitors she had to battle was a chef at the Élysée Palace, the residence of the French President.\nAfter an intense 3.5-hour competition, Bernadette triumphed, winning the coveted trophy. \"It was my first-ever competition and it was overseas, so there were a lot of unknowns. The biggest challenge was staying calm and open-minded in an unfamiliar environment. The competitors were incredibly talented, and the judges were top-notch, so the pressure was high!\" she shared.\nAll smiles for Bernadette Rozario (left) with her trophy in hand. (Photo: Bernardaud)\nBernadette’s love for cooking started early, sparked by watching her family’s domestic helper prepare meals that brought people together. “Food always had a special place in my life. Watching how it brought people together resonated with me. It wasn’t just about feeding people; it was about creating an emotional connection through the meals you serve,\" she shared. It was this very moment that nurtured the first seeds of her culinary ambitions.\nBernadette’s culinary career took off at French brasserie Claudine, where she started as a Chef de Partie (Station Chef) and worked her way up to sous-chef (Deputy Head Chef). The path to her current position was marked by challenges. However, with perseverance and support from mentors and colleagues, she developed the leadership skills and technical expertise needed to thrive in a fast-paced, high-pressure kitchen environment.\nIn an industry dominated by men, she has remained focused on her craft and refuses to let gender define her path. She shared, “I don’t walk into a kitchen thinking about whether I’m a woman in a male-dominated space. I walk in ready to prove that anyone with dedication and talent can succeed.”\nLeading up to the competition, Bernadette spent six weeks practising and perfecting her dish. While the dish, which is a symbol of French home-cooking, was a staple at Claudine, the focus was on refining the flavours and ensuring flawless execution. With just 3.5 hours to prepare the dish, including making a jus, she emphasised precision, consistency, and meticulous attention to detail in her preparations.\nYou may have a taste of Bernadette's winning dish at Claudine. (Photo: Bernerdaud)\nThe Winning Dish: A Plate of Tradition and Innovation\nThe recipe was originally created by three-Michelin-starred chef Julien Royer, owner of Claudine, who drew inspiration from his mother’s recipe. It was a dish that captured the essence of comfort and home-cooked flavours. \"We took her recipe and refined it, adding a luxurious twist with foie gras! What makes it special is how we’ve maintained the authenticity of the original while adding a touch of sophistication,\" Bernadette elaborated.\nBernadette credits her education at SIT and CIA Singapore for providing both the technical knowledge and the resilience needed to succeed in the culinary world. The hands-on curriculum played a pivotal role in shaping her journey, particularly her internship at Primo Restaurant in Maine, USA. There, she gained valuable experience, honed her techniques, and adapted to different culinary cultures, all of which helped her build the versatility needed for international competition.\n“SIT’s applied learning approach ensured that I wasn’t just learning about food in theory. I was constantly refining my basic techniques, developing precision, and understanding the discipline required to work in a kitchen.”\nThough she has no immediate plans to compete again, Bernadette remains committed to growing with Claudine and continuing to hone her skills. She hopes her achievement will inspire others to pursue their passions and challenge themselves. “I want this win to inspire others to push themselves and pursue their passions. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next.”\nTopics\nAlumni\nSITizens\nCulinary Arts\nAwards\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nBusiness, Communication and Design\nEngineering\nFood, Chemical and Biotechnology\nHealth and Social Sciences\nInfocomm Technology\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nview\nNext\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n11 Apr 2025\nTransforming Trash into Treasure: How an SIT Alumnus is Reshaping Sustainability with Semula\nTo Jeryl Yep, saving the environment is not just a lofty aspiration; it’s about solving real problems by creating economic value.
