    "Ultrasound plays a crucial role in the evaluation and management of patients with chronic and systemic diseases of the endocrine system.",
    "These include thyroiditis and other diseases such as breast cancer which are facing rising incidence as the ageing population grows.",
    "The workshop is introduced in response to the industry demand and government healthcare policy in expanding capacity in skills upgrading of the current healthcare workforce. It is an intensive “hands on” training program that aims to provide you with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills in small parts, namely breast ultrasound and lumps and bumps imaging. Breast intervention work, breast MRI and mammography as well as other advanced imaging techniques such as elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound will also be covered.",
    "At the end of this workshop, you will be able to recognise the normal and abnormal ultrasound findings and will be guided in the competent production, interpretation, and assessment of these small parts ultrasound images.",
    "Topics will include gross anatomy and physiology, embryology, clinical indications, equipment and patient preparation, techniques and sonographic protocol in the evaluation of breast, lymph nodes and soft tissue masses; and their normal sonographic anatomy and abnormal imaging findings.",
