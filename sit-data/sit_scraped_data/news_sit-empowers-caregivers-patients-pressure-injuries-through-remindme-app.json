    "SIT Empowers Caregivers of Patients with Pressure Injuries Through RemindMe App",
    "A new RemindMe app, developed by the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) in collaboration with Singapore General Hospital (SGH), equips caregivers with the knowledge, confidence, and support they need to care for patients with pressure injuries at home.",
    "A/Prof Siow (second from right) and the SGH nursing team, driving innovation in home-based pressure injury care with the RemindMe app. (Photo: Elaine Siow)",
    "For Grace (not her real name), life took an unexpected turn during an overseas holiday when her husband suffered a stroke. Suddenly, she became his full-time caregiver, facing the daunting task of managing complex medical needs like pressure injuries – localised damage to the skin and its underlying tissues due to prolonged lying or sitting in the same position.",
    "\"It was overwhelming,\" Grace recalled, \"trying to ensure my husband was repositioned correctly and managing his medications and feeding schedules. The fear of causing him further discomfort was always present.\"",
    "Bridging the Gap in Pressure Injury Care",
    "Patients and their caregivers often face numerous challenges, including emotional distress, physical limitations, and a lack of accessible resources. These everyday struggles can hinder recovery and overall quality of life, underscoring the need for stronger support systems.",
    "Recognising this gap, Associate Professor",
    "Elaine Siow",
    ", Programme Leader of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) - Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) at SIT, sought to make a difference. \"We recognised a significant gap in the resources available to caregivers,\" she explained.",
    "To address this, A/Prof Siow led the development of RemindMe, an app designed to equip caregivers with the knowledge, confidence and practical support needed to manage pressure injuries at home, in collaboration with SGH.",
    "The project is supported by the",
    "Community Leadership and Social Innovation Centre (CLASIC)",
    "at SIT, which fosters social innovation initiatives to benefit communities.",
    "A multidisciplinary team, including Engineering faculty members Associate Professor Desmond Chong and Mr Vincent Chan, along with SIT students, played a key role in designing and developing the app.",
    "\"Our aim was to create a user-friendly tool to empower caregivers with the necessary skills and information,\" A/Prof Siow shared.",
    "Empowering Caregivers Through Technology",
    "The RemindMe app includes several key features to support caregivers throughout their caregiving journey.",
    "Firstly, it provides scheduled reminders for patient repositioning to help prevent pressure injuries. The app also offers educational resources such as instructional videos and information on pressure injury management.",
    "There are also care management tools for daily tasks, such as tracking medication and feeding schedules. Finally, a pictorial guide highlights high-risk areas for pressure injuries during position changes.",
    "\"The app was designed to support caregivers throughout their caregiving journey,\" A/Prof Siow shared. \"With this goal in mind, we believe technology together with the human touch can foster better recovery and health outcomes.\"",
    "Snapshots of the RemindMe app (Photos: Elaine Siow)",
    "From Pilot to Practice",
    "The RemindMe app has since undergone thorough evaluation, with outcome measurements and caregiver feedback demonstrating its effectiveness.",
    "In a feasibility study conducted in 2024, 40 caregivers used the app, with a majority reporting it was useful and easy to use. Statistical analyses further indicated a significant improvement in caregiver knowledge and self-confidence in carrying out their tasks, alongside improved care for patients with pressure injuries. Notably, the app was primarily trialled with foreign domestic helpers (FHDs), who found the pictorial guide clear and easy to understand.",
    "The study also revealed that the caregivers found the app's alarm feature loud and clear, which was particularly helpful in reminding them to turn the patient. Their feedback also highlighted the need for additional information on specific care procedures like suctioning, urine catheter care, bed exercises, and tracheostomy care, which will be considered for future iterations of the app.",
    "\"Technology should not replace the caregiver's role but instead enhance it, making the recovery process a more collaborative and supportive experience,\" explained A/Prof Siow.",
    "Looking Ahead: Integrating RemindMe into Community Care",
    "A/Prof Siow's leadership has been instrumental in aligning the project with her research objectives. She envisions the app as a transformative tool in pressure injury care, blending innovative technology with human connection.",
    "Plans are now underway to integrate the RemindMe app into a community-based care bundle, providing a more holistic approach to managing pressure injuries at home. Complementing this effort, Ms Fazila Aloweni, a senior nurse researcher at SGH, is leading a doctoral study to examine the risk factors and outcomes of community-acquired pressure injuries. Her research will further inform the app’s integration into broader community healthcare settings.",
    "Fazila Aloweni (right), SGH Senior Nurse Researcher, leads doctoral work to understand community-acquired pressure injuries and to integrate the app into broader community healthcare settings. (Photo: Elaine Siow)",
    "Despite initial challenges such as participant recruitment, language barriers, and coordinating with the demanding schedules of FDHs, the study team successfully developed a practical solution that addresses a critical healthcare need. This project underscores the power of collaborative research in translating academic insights into real-world impact.",
    "A/Prof Siow believes that close collaboration between academics and clinicians is essential for driving meaningful healthcare innovation. By harnessing technology alongside compassionate care, the RemindMe app creates a supportive environment for both patients and caregivers. Through initiatives like this, SIT remains committed to impactful, community-driven research that addresses pressing healthcare challenges.",

Suddenly, she became his full-time caregiver, facing the daunting task of managing complex medical needs like pressure injuries – localised damage to the skin and its underlying tissues due to prolonged lying or sitting in the same position.\n\"It was overwhelming,\" Grace recalled, \"trying to ensure my husband was repositioned correctly and managing his medications and feeding schedules. The fear of causing him further discomfort was always present.\"\nBridging the Gap in Pressure Injury Care\nPatients and their caregivers often face numerous challenges, including emotional distress, physical limitations, and a lack of accessible resources. These everyday struggles can hinder recovery and overall quality of life, underscoring the need for stronger support systems.\nRecognising this gap, Associate Professor\nElaine Siow\n, Programme Leader of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) - Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) at SIT, sought to make a difference. \"We recognised a significant gap in the resources available to caregivers,\" she explained.\nTo address this, A/Prof Siow led the development of RemindMe, an app designed to equip caregivers with the knowledge, confidence and practical support needed to manage pressure injuries at home, in collaboration with SGH.\nThe project is supported by the\nCommunity Leadership and Social Innovation Centre (CLASIC)\nat SIT, which fosters social innovation initiatives to benefit communities.\nA multidisciplinary team, including Engineering faculty members Associate Professor Desmond Chong and Mr Vincent Chan, along with SIT students, played a key role in designing and developing the app.\n\"Our aim was to create a user-friendly tool to empower caregivers with the necessary skills and information,\" A/Prof Siow shared.\nEmpowering Caregivers Through Technology\nThe RemindMe app includes several key features to support caregivers throughout their caregiving journey.\nFirstly, it provides scheduled reminders for patient repositioning to help prevent pressure injuries. The app also offers educational resources such as instructional videos and information on pressure injury management.\nThere are also care management tools for daily tasks, such as tracking medication and feeding schedules. Finally, a pictorial guide highlights high-risk areas for pressure injuries during position changes.\n\"The app was designed to support caregivers throughout their caregiving journey,\" A/Prof Siow shared. \"With this goal in mind, we believe technology together with the human touch can foster better recovery and health outcomes.\"\nSnapshots of the RemindMe app (Photos: Elaine Siow)\nFrom Pilot to Practice\nThe RemindMe app has since undergone thorough evaluation, with outcome measurements and caregiver feedback demonstrating its effectiveness.\nIn a feasibility study conducted in 2024, 40 caregivers used the app, with a majority reporting it was useful and easy to use. Statistical analyses further indicated a significant improvement in caregiver knowledge and self-confidence in carrying out their tasks, alongside improved care for patients with pressure injuries. Notably, the app was primarily trialled with foreign domestic helpers (FHDs), who found the pictorial guide clear and easy to understand.\nThe study also revealed that the caregivers found the app's alarm feature loud and clear, which was particularly helpful in reminding them to turn the patient. Their feedback also highlighted the need for additional information on specific care procedures like suctioning, urine catheter care, bed exercises, and tracheostomy care, which will be considered for future iterations of the app.\n\"Technology should not replace the caregiver's role but instead enhance it, making the recovery process a more collaborative and supportive experience,\" explained A/Prof Siow.\nLooking Ahead: Integrating RemindMe into Community Care\nA/Prof Siow's leadership has been instrumental in aligning the project with her research objectives. She envisions the app as a transformative tool in pressure injury care, blending innovative technology with human connection.\nPlans are now underway to integrate the RemindMe app into a community-based care bundle, providing a more holistic approach to managing pressure injuries at home. Complementing this effort, Ms Fazila Aloweni, a senior nurse researcher at SGH, is leading a doctoral study to examine the risk factors and outcomes of community-acquired pressure injuries. Her research will further inform the app’s integration into broader community healthcare settings.\nFazila Aloweni (right), SGH Senior Nurse Researcher, leads doctoral work to understand community-acquired pressure injuries and to integrate the app into broader community healthcare settings. (Photo: Elaine Siow)\nDespite initial challenges such as participant recruitment, language barriers, and coordinating with the demanding schedules of FDHs, the study team successfully developed a practical solution that addresses a critical healthcare need. This project underscores the power of collaborative research in translating academic insights into real-world impact.\nA/Prof Siow believes that close collaboration between academics and clinicians is essential for driving meaningful healthcare innovation. By harnessing technology alongside compassionate care, the RemindMe app creates a supportive environment for both patients and caregivers. Through initiatives like this, SIT remains committed to impactful, community-driven research that addresses pressing healthcare challenges.\nTopics\nCLASIC\nNursing\nSIT Expert Spotlight\nCATEGORIES\nApplied Research & Innovation\nHealth and Social Sciences\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\n3D-Printing: Crafting a Competitive Edge\nview\nNext\nEquipping Professionals with Critical Sustainability Expertise\nview\nRelated News\n14 May 2025\nEmpowering Stroke Survivors through Sport: SIT and SNSA-Led Campaign Earns Global Praise\nEmpowering fitness professionals to support stroke survivors for an inclusive fitness community.\ntag\nApplied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n09 May 2025\nLiving Medicine: How Engineered Bacteria Evolved from Combating Amebiasis to Revolutionising Cancer Treatment\nThe groundbreaking concept of engineered bacteria, initially developed to combat the parasitic infection amebiasis, has evolved into a revolutionary approach for treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma -by delivering cancer-fighting drugs with pinpoint accuracy\ntag\nApplied Research & Innovation\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences"
