He played a leading role in the development of patented technology leading to inexpensive thermal storage, and conducted research on novel approaches to designing and optimising Phase Change Material storage systems. These innovations coupled with successful commercialisation have won the highly esteemed ANSTO Eureka Prize for Innovative Use of Technology and Australian Institute of Refrigeration Air conditioning and Heating Research Excellence Award.",
    "In 2012, he was awarded a three-year Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, focusing on high temperature phase change thermal energy storage system for concentrated solar power plant applications. He has authored or co-authored more than 50 journal and conference papers, 1 Book and 1 Book Chapter. He was awarded the 2016 Sir George Julius Medal for his paper which demonstrated how phase change materials can be used to reduce energy for cooling buildings. His Google Scholar citation data gives an H-index of 25, citations over 3,200.",
    "Dr Tay is a Fellow of The Higher Education Academy with over 10 years of teaching experience in mechanical design, thermodynamics and heat transfer, project management and energy. He also has over 10 years of industry experience in mechanical design, primarily in automated systems, jigs and fixtures and semiconductor equipment.
