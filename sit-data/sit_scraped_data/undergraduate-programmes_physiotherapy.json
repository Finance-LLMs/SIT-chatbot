    "The Bachelor of Science with Honours in Physiotherapy programme is a four-year, direct honours degree programme. The programme aims to produce professional physiotherapists who are theoretically-grounded and clinically-oriented to practise autonomously in different specialities of physiotherapy.",
    "Physiotherapy involves the assessment, treatment, rehabilitation and prevention of pain, injury, or any other physical dysfunction and health condition, through the use of education, exercise, manual therapy, and other treatment modalities with the aim of maximizing the quality of life for individuals.",
    "Students in the programme will have opportunities to gain clinical experience through clinical attachments with various major hospitals and healthcare facilities in Singapore.  The four-year degree programme was developed in consultation with clinical partners to ensure the relevancy of the skill sets and employability of the students upon graduation.",
    "The programme is accredited by the Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC), thus enabling graduates to obtain direct registration to practise as physiotherapists in a wide variety of settings in Singapore. Mid-career individuals with a prior degree qualification in a science-related field may apply for the Physiotherapy programme under the Career Conversion Programme (CCP).",
    "Do note that the healthcare staff guidelines and requirements that apply to healthcare institutions also apply to Health Sciences students. Non-compliance with these guidelines may affect your ability in meeting course requirements, graduating, obtaining registration or employment, and fulfilling bond obligations. It is crucial to adhere to these guidelines to ensure successful completion of your studies and future professional opportunities in the healthcare field.",
    "Curriculum",
    "For students to be awarded the Bachelor of Science with Honours in Physiotherapy, they need to successfully complete eleven trimesters of study, which includes completing an individual honours thesis and a minimum of 25 weeks of clinical attachments. The quality of the curriculum is ensured through regular consultations with external examiners, Industry Advisory Committee, clinical partners, professional associations as well as accreditation process through the AHPC.",
    "Remote video URL",
    "Clinical Practice Education",
    "All Physiotherapy students need to undergo around 1000 hours of clinical practice education (CPE) across various clinical settings. Such clinical placements prepare students for the real-world clinical practice. Therefore, students get to apply theoretical and clinical knowledge and build up their confidence in clinical skills. Students need to pass all clinical placements to graduate from the programme and to be registered under the Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC).",
    "Students may be eligible for an exit award \"Bachelor of Science in Care Sciences\" if they fail to meet clinical practice education module requirements for the award of an honours degree, subject to fulfilling conditions for the exit award.",
