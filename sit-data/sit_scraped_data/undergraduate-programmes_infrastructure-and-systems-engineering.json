    "The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Infrastructure and Systems Engineering (ISE) is a four-year direct honours programme designed and delivered via our pioneering competency-based education approach. This programme aims to train skilled professionals who are in demand by the various industry sectors that require mechanical engineers.",
    "The BEng ISE programme is aligned with the university’s focus on Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering and Maintenance, and supports Singapore's national priorities under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 plans. With emphasis on skills relevant to critical domains such as Manufacturing, Trade, and Connectivity; Urban Solutions and Sustainability; and Smart Nation and Digital Economy, graduates are well-prepared to address the growing demand for skilled professionals in these forward-looking areas.",
    "The skills taught in the programme are highly versatile and transferable; they can be applied across various engineering industries, including transport, logistics, and engineering services. This aligns with insights from the Skills Demand for the Future Economy report, highlighting the broad relevance of these competencies in today's job market. The programme allows students to specialise in several areas such as Railway Engineering and others.",
    "Competency-based Education",
    "The ISE programme is the first-of-its-kind engineering degree programme delivered through the CBE approach. This approach emphasises practical mastery of key competencies, shifting away from traditional academic curricula. The curriculum comprises a blend of modules and learning blocks, specifically designed to help students acquire and master skills that are directly applicable to real-world engineering problems.",
    "Each learning block is self-contained to train students to acquire a set of related competencies. It includes an integrated project based on real-world scenarios, allowing students to apply and demonstrate their newly acquired competencies.",
    "Some examples of the learning blocks in the ISE programme include Engineering Design & Solutioning, and Smart Maintenance.",
    "Integrated Work Study Programme",
    "We aim to strengthen Singapore's pipeline of engineering talent to meet the growing demand for skilled engineers in critical sectors such as public transport, logistics, and engineering services. Singapore’s rapid development and national initiatives like Smart Nation and Manufacturing 2030 have created a strong need for engineers with advanced expertise.",
    "The BEng ISE programme works closely with our industry partners to ensure our students develop professional competencies through an 8-month Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) that complements industry capstone and applied research projects.",
