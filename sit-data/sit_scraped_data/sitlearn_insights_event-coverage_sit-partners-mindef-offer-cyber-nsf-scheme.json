    "Mr Ong also announced the Cyber NSF Scheme, which all full-time national servicemen (NSFs) in cyber vocations will now come under, and the Cyber Specialist Award, a short-term contract which will be offered to selected cyber NSFs who demonstrate the requisite aptitude and skill, and who meet the stringent selection requirements for the award.",
    "The MOU between DCO and SIT is the first work-learn tie-up between MINDEF and an education institute where NSFs are sent for academic upgrading while employed in an operational role. This will equip them with the necessary skills to better perform their duties, and was made possible through close collaboration between MINDEF, the Cyber Security Agency (CSA)[1], SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and SIT. This work-learn programme will be applicable to NSFs who are recipients of the Cyber Specialist Award. Award recipients will also attend professional courses and attain professional certifications.",
    "Mr Ong said that the new Cyber NSF Scheme and Cyber Specialist Award aim to tap on those in the NSF talent pool who wish to contribute more to national defence in cyber. He said, “MINDEF/SAF has developed a new Cyber NSF scheme that will be able to tap on cyber talents from our NSF pool to bolster the SAF’s cyber defences… We will look at both academic qualifications as well as relevant cyber skills in our selection process. This scheme allows us to tap unto our talented NSFs to meet the operational requirements of our cyber defences, and also allows us to optimise their contribution by giving them the opportunity to apply their cybersecurity skills in the defence of the nation.” He also expressed his hope that the time spent as cyber specialists would help them make the decision to continue honing their cybersecurity skills and contribute to Singapore’s cyber defence as professionals in the national cyber eco-system.",
