That makes them very at-\ntractive to be targeted by food in-\ntervention,” he said.\nFor instance, a high-fibre, low-\nprocessed diet rich in fruits, vegeta-\nbles, nuts and seeds helps benefi-\ncial bacteria  flourish in the  gut,\nsaid Prof Pettersson.\nThe  centre  is  also  working\nclosely with the local food industry to develop  next-generation  food\nproducts to help gut microbes bet-\nter support human health and the\nageing body.\nProfessor Louis Tan, senior con-\nsultant neurologist and director at\nNNI’s department of research, said\nthat the first research linking the\ngut microbiome to the brain was\npublished less than 20 years ago.\nIt was found that microbes could\neither be beneficial or detrimental,\ndepending on one’s diet and life-\nstyle, which are the “master regula-\ntors” of human health, he said.\nFor instance, the microbes could\nsecrete metabolites that reduce in-\nflammation and improve memory\nor metabolites that accelerate in-\nflammation  and  age-related  dis-\nease symptoms in the body.\n“There is still much we do not\nknow. NNI is glad to collaborate\nwith researchers from around the world to advance knowledge and\ncare for our patients,” said Prof Tan.\nThe centre is also engaging re-\nsearchers in Europe, North Amer-\nica and Asia to identify how micro-\nbial mechanisms regulate ageing.\nIt is supported by the UK Dementia\nResearch Institute and was set up\nwith  funding  from  the  Jeffrey\nCheah Foundation.\nDr Anusha Jayaraman, executive\ndirector of the centre and a senior\nresearch fellow at NNI, said studies\nhave also shown that urbanisation\nand human civilisation have led to\ndecreased gut microbiome diver-\nsity  compared  with  humans’\nhunter-gatherer ancestors.\n“Human  activity  and  modern\nlifestyle  have  not  only  affected\nplanetary health but have had seri-\nous effects on microbial ecosys-\ntems, including the human micro-\nbiome.  Thus,  policies  that  are  designed  to  tackle  planetary\nhealth – such as more sustainable\nlifestyles – may be important for\ntackling  microbiome  health  as\nwell,” said Dr Jayaraman.\nShe noted that the centre is cur-\nrently  in  discussions  with  local\nchef school At-Sunrice to seek solu-\ntions that combine microbiome re-\nsearch with recycled food to im-\nprove human health.\nSeparately, the Singapore Insti-\ntute  of  Technology  (SIT)  and\nAmili, which is South-east Asia’s\nfirst precision gut microbiome re-\nsearch company, said on June 3\nthat they had formalised a three-\nyear partnership to accelerate in-\nnovation in the field.\nThey will embark on a series of re-\nsearch  and  development  pro-\ngrammes,  staff  upskilling  initia-\ntives, and work attachment oppor-\ntunities for SIT students.\nOne of the initiatives includes\nlooking at kale stems as prebiotics\n– types of fibre that feed the good\nbacteria found in the digestive sys-\ntem. These leftover farmed vegeta-\nbles can be strong catalysts for the\ngrowth of Bifidobacterium  and Lac-\ntobacillus , both of which are essen-\ntial intestinal bacteria that aid in\nthe maintenance of a healthy gut\nsystem.\ntansuwen@sph.com.sgResearchers hope to find ways to manage\ndiseases related to ageing and lifestyle New centre launched to study\nimpact of gut bacteria on health\nPublication: The S traits Times\nDate: 13 June 2022\nHeadline: New cent re launched to\nstudy impact of gut bacteria on health\nSource: The St raits Times © SPH Media Limited.
