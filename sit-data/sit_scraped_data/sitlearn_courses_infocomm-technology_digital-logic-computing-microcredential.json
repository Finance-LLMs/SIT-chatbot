    "This introductory-level micro-credential prepares learners with foundational skills for a career in Information Technology (IT) or advanced studies through four key competencies in digital and IT fundamentals, programming, as well as logic and discrete structures.",
    "As a learner, you will develop an Infocomm Technology (ICT) mindset and grasp the significance and interconnections of various computing technologies in the area of digital and IT fundamentals. Key topics include digital data presentation, digital circuits, computer architecture, software development life cycle (SDLC), databases, algorithms, and security.",
    "Basic programming concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, recursion, arrays, pointers, files, and data structures will also be introduced so that the learners can design, implement and test programs to solve real-world problems. This will be taught using the C programming language.",
    "In the area of logic and discrete structures, you will explore introductory topics such as basic logic, proof strategies and techniques, functions, relations and sets, sequences and series, divisibility and modular arithmetic, and permutation. These topics lay the foundation for algorithm design, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.",
    "Integrating online and in-person delivery, the micro-credential offers various learning activities such as interactive videos, discussion forums, Q&A live sessions, and laboratory sessions. You will gain valuable insights into implementing digital components and logical principles in programs to enable automation.",
