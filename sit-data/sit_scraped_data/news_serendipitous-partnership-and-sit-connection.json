    "A Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection",
    "Meet SITizen Ng Yan Ying, a trailblazer in the field of physiotherapy, whose journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.",
    "When Ng Yan Ying applied to SIT more than 10 years ago, she never imagined running her own private practice together with a senior from the Physiotherapy degree programme jointly offered by SIT and Trinity College Dublin. ‘YY’, as she is fondly referred to by her friends, always thought that she would remain a clinician in a public hospital, especially when she joined Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) after graduating in 2016.",
    "Her education at SIT not only honed her skills but also developed her passion for patient care. In her role as physiotherapist, she focused on advancing physiotherapy care, particularly in the field of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. Through sheer determination and hard work, she worked her way up to senior physiotherapist and clinical lead for cardiothoracic surgery at TTSH over seven years. She also led the implementation of a care stream for cardiothoracic physiotherapy, where she helped develop and refine pre- and post-operative rehabilitation protocols for patients undergoing major heart and lung surgeries.",
    "It was also at TTSH that YY first met her business partner, Jaclyn Chow. Not only did they discover they were both SIT alumna, they quickly bonded over the same shared values and clinical passion and developed an effortless working chemistry -- a connection that grew stronger over time. Their joint work even gained recognition, garnering them a Singapore Allied Health Silver Award in 2019 for improving early mobilisation in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU), an initiative that enhanced patient outcomes and reduced ICU stays.",
    "The Call to Do More",
    "To deepen her expertise and refine her approach to patient management, YY completed her Master of Science in Physiotherapy (Cardiorespiratory & Musculoskeletal specialisation) with Merit from Cardiff University in 2020. She also embraced leadership roles, teaching opportunities, and research collaborations as she progressed in her career. These experiences helped her grow as a clinician, educator, and advocate for better physiotherapy practices in Singapore. But what has given her the most satisfaction is seeing the improvements in patient recovery and their quality of life.",
    "YY saw a growing need for continuity of care beyond hospital walls. This realisation led her to shift focus toward helping patients recover and maintain long-term health post-discharge.",
    "She decided to transition to private practice and take a “leap of faith” to co-found her own clinic –",
    "Heart & Lung Physio Singapore",
    "– in 2022 with Jaclyn. Her aim? To take her passion for cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and evidence-based physiotherapy into a space where she could provide highly personalised care for patients.",
    "YY (left) with her business partner, Jaclyn, when they opened their own clinic. (Photo: Ng Yan Ying)",
    "Today, YY develops specialised rehabilitation programmes for patients recovering from heart and lung conditions, focusing on prehabilitation, post-operative recovery, and chronic disease management. And the practice is thriving – her team recently celebrated the opening of their second outlet.",
    "YY (right) with some of her patients at Heart and Lung Physio. (Photo: Ng Yan Ying)",
    "The Wisdom of Experience",
    "Asked what she would tell her younger self, now that she has been practising for close to a decade, YY exhorts:",
    "\"Trust the process and be open to every learning opportunity that comes your way. Your career is a journey, and every challenge you face will shape you into a better clinician. Seek mentorship, never stop learning, and most importantly, always put your patients first.”",
    "For her, choosing SIT was a no-brainer.",
    "“I chose SIT because of its strong emphasis on applied learning, clinical exposure, and industry relevance. The partnership with overseas universities provided a curriculum that was both evidence-based and practical, ensuring we were well-equipped to handle real-world healthcare challenges. Additionally, the small class sizes and hands-on teaching approach made it a great environment for learning. SIT also had strong hospital partnerships, which allowed us to gain extensive clinical experience before even graduating. Looking back, it was the perfect choice for someone who wanted to be a competent, well-rounded physiotherapist.”",
    "Wanting to give back to the SIT community that shaped her, YY became a mentor to budding physiotherapists, where she offers insights into the practicalities, challenges, and key considerations of establishing and running a clinic, helping her juniors better prepare for the journey ahead.",
    "Making Music & Deepening Relationships",
    "While physiotherapy is a passion, YY has various ways to unwind and recharge. One of her biggest escapes is through music – she plays the saxophone in a band – and for her, this has become an incredible creative outlet.",
    "“There’s something about making music, whether it’s rehearsing or performing, that helps me reset and de-stress from the pressures of work.”",
    "YY (front row, 2",
    "nd",
    "from right) unwinding with her band, WestWinds, after a performance at the Esplanade. (Photo: Ng Yan Ying)",
    "She also embraces the outdoors, especially hiking, as it gives her a sense of calm and clarity. And of course, nothing beats quality time with family and friends, whether it’s over a meal, a coffee catch-up, or just having meaningful conversations.",
    "“My family and close friends have always been my biggest support system, providing encouragement and perspective when I need it. Having people who genuinely care and listen makes all the difference,”",
    "she enthuses.",
    "YY (centre) with her current team of practitioners at Heart and Lung Physio. (Photo: Ng Yan Ying)",
    "On a professional level, YY leans on a strong support network of colleagues, mentors, and fellow physiotherapists who understand the challenges of the field. Whether it’s discussing complex cases, sharing knowledge, or venting after a tough day, it is this network that keeps her grounded and inspired.",

In her role as physiotherapist, she focused on advancing physiotherapy care, particularly in the field of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. Through sheer determination and hard work, she worked her way up to senior physiotherapist and clinical lead for cardiothoracic surgery at TTSH over seven years. She also led the implementation of a care stream for cardiothoracic physiotherapy, where she helped develop and refine pre- and post-operative rehabilitation protocols for patients undergoing major heart and lung surgeries.\nIt was also at TTSH that YY first met her business partner, Jaclyn Chow. Not only did they discover they were both SIT alumna, they quickly bonded over the same shared values and clinical passion and developed an effortless working chemistry -- a connection that grew stronger over time. Their joint work even gained recognition, garnering them a Singapore Allied Health Silver Award in 2019 for improving early mobilisation in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU), an initiative that enhanced patient outcomes and reduced ICU stays.\nThe Call to Do More\nTo deepen her expertise and refine her approach to patient management, YY completed her Master of Science in Physiotherapy (Cardiorespiratory & Musculoskeletal specialisation) with Merit from Cardiff University in 2020. She also embraced leadership roles, teaching opportunities, and research collaborations as she progressed in her career. These experiences helped her grow as a clinician, educator, and advocate for better physiotherapy practices in Singapore. But what has given her the most satisfaction is seeing the improvements in patient recovery and their quality of life.\nYY saw a growing need for continuity of care beyond hospital walls. This realisation led her to shift focus toward helping patients recover and maintain long-term health post-discharge.\nShe decided to transition to private practice and take a “leap of faith” to co-found her own clinic –\nHeart & Lung Physio Singapore\n– in 2022 with Jaclyn. Her aim? To take her passion for cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and evidence-based physiotherapy into a space where she could provide highly personalised care for patients.\nYY (left) with her business partner, Jaclyn, when they opened their own clinic. (Photo: Ng Yan Ying)\nToday, YY develops specialised rehabilitation programmes for patients recovering from heart and lung conditions, focusing on prehabilitation, post-operative recovery, and chronic disease management. And the practice is thriving – her team recently celebrated the opening of their second outlet.\nYY (right) with some of her patients at Heart and Lung Physio. (Photo: Ng Yan Ying)\nThe Wisdom of Experience\nAsked what she would tell her younger self, now that she has been practising for close to a decade, YY exhorts:\n\"Trust the process and be open to every learning opportunity that comes your way. Your career is a journey, and every challenge you face will shape you into a better clinician. Seek mentorship, never stop learning, and most importantly, always put your patients first.”\nFor her, choosing SIT was a no-brainer.\n“I chose SIT because of its strong emphasis on applied learning, clinical exposure, and industry relevance. The partnership with overseas universities provided a curriculum that was both evidence-based and practical, ensuring we were well-equipped to handle real-world healthcare challenges. Additionally, the small class sizes and hands-on teaching approach made it a great environment for learning. SIT also had strong hospital partnerships, which allowed us to gain extensive clinical experience before even graduating. Looking back, it was the perfect choice for someone who wanted to be a competent, well-rounded physiotherapist.”\nWanting to give back to the SIT community that shaped her, YY became a mentor to budding physiotherapists, where she offers insights into the practicalities, challenges, and key considerations of establishing and running a clinic, helping her juniors better prepare for the journey ahead.\nMaking Music & Deepening Relationships\nWhile physiotherapy is a passion, YY has various ways to unwind and recharge. One of her biggest escapes is through music – she plays the saxophone in a band – and for her, this has become an incredible creative outlet.\n“There’s something about making music, whether it’s rehearsing or performing, that helps me reset and de-stress from the pressures of work.”\nYY (front row, 2\nnd\nfrom right) unwinding with her band, WestWinds, after a performance at the Esplanade. (Photo: Ng Yan Ying)\nShe also embraces the outdoors, especially hiking, as it gives her a sense of calm and clarity. And of course, nothing beats quality time with family and friends, whether it’s over a meal, a coffee catch-up, or just having meaningful conversations.\n“My family and close friends have always been my biggest support system, providing encouragement and perspective when I need it. Having people who genuinely care and listen makes all the difference,”\nshe enthuses.\nYY (centre) with her current team of practitioners at Heart and Lung Physio. (Photo: Ng Yan Ying)\nOn a professional level, YY leans on a strong support network of colleagues, mentors, and fellow physiotherapists who understand the challenges of the field. Whether it’s discussing complex cases, sharing knowledge, or venting after a tough day, it is this network that keeps her grounded and inspired.\nTopics\nAllied Health\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nHealth and Social Sciences\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nview\nNext\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering\n08 Apr 2025\nBridging the Gap Between Theory and Industry\nGloria Kwek, a final-year Electrical Power Engineering student at SIT, began her IWSP journey with the mindset of an intern but emerged feeling like a valued and integral member of the team.\ntag\nEducation"
