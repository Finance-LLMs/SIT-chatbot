    "The Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Civil Engineering is a three-year direct honours degree programme jointly offered by SIT and the University of Glasgow.",
    "This programme will play an important role in addressing the lack of local graduate manpower with the necessary civil engineering professional qualifications for the building and construction industry in the face of sustained building and infrastructure development. With a strong emphasis on project-based learning and industrial immersion, this programme aims to produce industry-ready graduates who are equipped with a high level of technical expertise to address multidisciplinary challenges, provide technically sound, economically feasible and sustainable solutions for complex problems.",
    "The Bachelor of Engineering with Honours and Master of Science programmes aim to produce work-ready graduates who, after working three to five years, are expected to:",
    "Be technically competent for a successful career in the civil engineering profession.",
    "Have analytical, problem-solving and lifelong learning skills to manage civil engineering projects in a rapidly changing world.",
    "Be able to address multidisciplinary challenges and provide technically sound, economically feasible and sustainable solutions.",
    "Be able to lead in their profession, community and public service with effective communication, high ethical, and professional standards.",
    "Upon successful completion of this programme, students may continue on to the Master of Science in Civil Engineering, which will qualify them to register for the professional examinations, conducted by the Professional Engineers Board of Singapore. The programme may be taken on a part-time basis, normally over 5 trimesters whilst in full time employment, or on a full time basis over 3 trimesters. In this way, students can study at a pace that best suits their individual needs.",
    "The programme offers specialist training in the areas of Structural and Geotechnical Engineering, with a strong emphasis placed on the industrial relevance of the curriculum, which has been developed in consultation with government agencies and companies from the construction sector.",

    "Integrated Work Study Programme",
    "Students will undergo an eight-month continuous structured learning and work programme in the construction industry that exposes them to both design office and field/site supervision experience. The learning experience is more structured than an internship, with objectives and corresponding assessments in career and professional skills, integration of knowledge and practice, and innovation skills. In addition, the Capstone Project is embedded within the IWSP, and students will start to formalise and propose their projects during the first trimester of IWSP with input from their industrial supervisors.",
    "Field/site supervision experience is mandatory for professional registration and this experience can contribute to the recognition of work experience required for registration as a resident engineer with IES/ACES.",
    "Overseas Immersion Programme",
    "Students will participate in an intensive three-week Overseas Immersion Programme (OIP) at the home campus of the University of Glasgow where they get to experience life as a student in Glasgow, United Kingdom. The programme itinerary includes academic lectures and workshops covering interdisciplinary design innovation to prepare students for their subsequent group design projects, as well as visits to key cultural sites.",
