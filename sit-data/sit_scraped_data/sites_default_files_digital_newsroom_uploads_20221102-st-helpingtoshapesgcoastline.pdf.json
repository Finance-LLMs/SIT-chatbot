And helping\nSingapore to–literally –\nalter its coastline tomake\nconstructing thes ebuildings\nareality, is Er Professor Tan\nThiam Soon.\nOne of Er Prof Tan’skey\nresearch contributions is the\noptimisation of unwanted soils\ngenerated from construction\nsites, so that it can be used in\nland reclamation projects. This\ninnovative reuse-and-recycle\nprocess has turned millions\nof cubic metres of exca vated\nsoilsfromconstruction sites\nhere, which were originally\ndesignated for disposal ,into\nﬁll materials which can be\nused for Singapore ’sfuture\nland reclamation work.\nEr Prof Tan’ssustainability-\ndriven solution is particularly\nuseful in Singapore –which\nis land-scarce and where\nland reclamation materials\nare limited –and has helped\nreduce the amount of sand\nneeded tobe purchased from\nOneo fE rP rofessorTanThiam Soon’skeyresearchresultedintheoptimisa tionofunwantedsoilsgener atedfromconstruction\nsitest ob er eusedi nl andreclamat ionprojects.PHOTO:LIANHE ZAOBAO\nneighbouring countries .The\nscheme was successfully\nimplemented in the Pulau\nTekong land reclamation\nproject in 2000.\nThe Institute Professor\nat the Singapore Institute of\nTechnology has consulted\nfor most of Singapore ’smajor\nland reclamation projects over\nthe last 30 years, including\nPunggol, Changi South Bay,\nPulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong.\nHis research, specialising in\ninnovative land reclamation\nsolutions ,has also made\nimportant contributions to\nhow thes ecoastline-shaping\nprojects have been carried out.\n“Er Prof Tan’sexemplary\nleadershi pand inno vations\nin geotechnical engineering\nhave led tostrategic industry\ntransformations, particularly in\nthe area of land reclamation.\nHe is truly arole model and\ninspi ration topresent and\nfuture engineers, ”says\nEr Chua Tong Seng, aPEB\nboard member.Er Pr ofTan’s\nexemplary\nleadership and\ninnovations in\ngeotechnical\nengineering\nhaveled to\nstrategic industry\ntransformations,\nparticular lyin\ntheareaofland\nreclamation.
