  "content": "HERE in Singapore, we love our\nfood. It is therefore fitting that Sin-\ngapore is home to avibrantlocal\nfood manufacturing industry ,with\nover 1,000companies producing\nbeverages, confectionery ,dairy,\nsnacks and more. TeeYih Jia’s\nSpring Home frozen food products\nand Cocoba’s Irvins chips, for in-\nstance, can be found in many parts\nof the world, from the Philippines\nto the United States.\nIn recent years, Singapore’s\ndrive to promote innovation, in-\ncluding nove lfoods such as alter-\nnative proteins, has also led to the\nRepublic emerging as the “Silicon\nValley of food” in Asia. For exam-\nple, Singapore became the first\ncountry to approve the sale of lab-\ngrown chicken in 2020.\nInno vate, or st agnate\nIn Asia, spending on food is expect-\ned to more than double from US$4\ntrillion (S$5.56 trillion) to over\nUS$8 trillion by 2030. This brings\nnew and exciting opportunities for\nfood manufacturers.\nHowever ,thisi sah ighly com-\npetitive industry ,with companies\nfacing the constant need to adapt\nto changing consume rdemands.\nThe pandemic has placed a\ngreater focus on food that is conve-\nnient and at the same time health-\nier,tastier and more sustainable.\nThe ageing population in Asia\nand around the world also means\nan increase ddemand for nutri-\ntious food that suits the diets of theelderly.\nInnovatio nwillb ee ssential for\ncompanie st om eet evolving con-\nsumer demands and capture\ngrowth. Innovation allows compa-\nnies to develop aniche and capture\nmarket share both locally and over-\nseas.\nThis can come in the form of\nnew products that appeal to differ-\nent consume rsegments, or prod-\nuct differentiation as ameans of\nstanding out from the competition.\nIt is understandable that many\nsmall and medium-sized enter-\nprise (SMEs) may find innovation\ndaunting and even complex as\nthere are costs involved and exper-\ntise required to embark on this\njourney.\nSome SMEs have held back from\nmaking the investments in devel-\noping new products due to the\nneed to conserve financial re-\nsources amid lower revenues,\nwhile others may see it as the pre-\nrogative of bigger companies.\nHowever ,withgreater competi-\ntion and tighter margins due to re-\ncent increase si ne nergy costs and\nraw materials, it is even more im-\nportant for companies to find that\nniche sooner rather than later.\nShar edfacilitie sandservices\nToaddress concerns over lack of\nfacilities and costly equipment, the\ngovernment has put in place re-\nsources to help our food compa-\nnies. For instance, Enterprise Sin-\ngapore (EnterpriseSG) launched\nmulti-agency initiative FoodInno-\nvate in 20 18,tomake it easier for\nfood companies to innovate andcommercialise their offerings.\nFoodInnovate offers shared fa-\ncilities, equips companies with in-\nnovation capabilities and provides\nsupporting access to anetwo rk of\npartners. Todate,i thas supported\ncompanies with the commerciali-\nsation of close to 400 new prod-\nucts.\nSwee Heng Bakery’s low gly-\ncaemic index pandan chiffon cake\nis an example of aprodu ct that was\ndeveloped through FoodInnovate,\nviaacollaboration with Alchemy\nFoodtech.\nMore recently ,EnterpriseSG,\nJTC and the Singapore Institute of\nTechnology (SIT) launched Food-\nPlant, ashared facility for small-\nbatch food manufacturing in the\nJTC Food Hub@Senoko. Instead of\nmaking their own investments,\nfood companies can rent produc-\ntion rooms and awide range of\nhigh-tech processing equipment\nhoused at the FoodPlant, thus sav-\ning operating costs.\nFor example, the facility’s twin-screw extruder ,using high mois-\nture extrusion technology ,allows\ncompanies to produce plant-based\nmeat products to capture anew\ncustom er segment.\nThose looking to export or pro-\nduce shelf-stable products can also\nmake use of new technologies such\nas retort machines to extend or im-\nprove their product’s shelf life.\nFish Soup Paradise, alocal re stau-\nrant that sells broths in takeaway\nretort pouches, intends to use re-\ntort technology to extend the prod-\nuct’s shelf life from 3m onths\nstored frozen, to 6monthsa ta mbi-\nent storage.\nCompanies who need exper tad-\nvice can speak to aconsultant for\nassistance and recommendations\nin emerging areas such as future\nfoods, elderl ynutrition and ad-\nvanced food processing.\nShortening the inno vationcycle\nAnothe rcommon challenge that\nSMEs face is the difficulty in dem-\nonstrating ‘proof of concept’, aswell as the long gestation period\nwhen it comes to R&D and innova-\ntion. Many SMEs are not able to find\nsuitable original equipment manu-\nfacturers (OEMs) who can work\nwith them on pilot testing needs.\nFoodPlant provides the option\nof testing the viability o fnew prod-\nucts through small-batch produc-\ntion. This allows SMEs to conduct\nR&D and develop new products in\nsmall batches without having to\nmeet aminimum order quantity,\nwhich i softenrequired by OEMs.\nWithFoodPlant being afood-li-\ncensed facility –that is ,foodprod-\nucts manufactured there can be\nsold fo rcommercial purposes –\nSMEs can now validate new prod-\nucts after R& Dandconduct rapid\nmarket testing before going for\nfull-scale production. This encour-\nages product experimentation at\nminimal costs.\nPartnerships to boost inno vation\nCollaborations can be acritical en-\nabler in innovation. Working with\nthe right overseas partners allows\nSMEs to grow their expertise,\nknowledge an dn etworks to\nachieve better outcomes.\nFor example, EnterpriseSG has\nbeen collaborating with Monash\nFood Innovation Centre since 2 019\ntosupport foo dmanufacturers in\ndeveloping new products or loca-\nlising their products t omeetthe\nneeds of Australian consumers.\nSMEs like Chocoworks, which\nmakes healthier chocolates with\nlittle t on os ugar,havetapped this\ncollaboration to gather feedback\nfrom Australian consumers on\ntheir products. Chocoworks in-\ntends to apply this knowledge to\nits future product development for\nthe Australian market.\nSIT and FoodPlant are also work-\ning with Foodbowl New Zealand, a\ngovernment-supported ,p ilot-\nscale food processing facility locat-\ned in New Zealand, to develop ca-\npabilities in food innovation and\nmanufacturing across shared facil-ities. Both FoodPlant and Foodbowl\nNew Zealand will explore collabo-\nrations to develop new technolo-\ngies that improve food manufac-\nturing processes and meet sustain-\nability goals.\nGrooming talent to support\ninno vation\nInnovation cannot be done without\nthe right talent. Weencour age com-\npanies to take along-term view and\ninvest in human capital.\nThere are courses already avail-\nable. SIT offers training on the use\nof the high-tech equipment availa-\nble in FoodPlant. For example, a\nnew first-of-its-kind continuing\neducation training course in high\nmoisture extrusion technology\n(HMET )will teach food technology\nprofessional sabout th eH MET\nprocess that texturises plant-based\nprotein into viable meat alterna-\ntives, and train them to use the\nhigh moisture extruder.\nTofurther develop astrong\npipeline of talent in this area, Enter-\npriseSG is working closely with\nSkillsFuture Singapore and Work-\nforce Singapore to identify other\nemerging skills that will be re-\nquired to support our food compa-\nnies with their innovation. Wewill\ndevelop training courses or talent\nexchange programmes to address\nthese new areas.\nEmbr acing inno vation\nWith all these resources and sup-\nport on hand, we encourage more\nSMEs to adopt an open mindset and\ntake the first step on their innova-\ntion journey .W el ookforward to\nthe launch of more new ,innovative\nproducts both locally and over-\nseas. This will further Singapore’s\nefforts to be aleading food and nu-\ntrition hub in Asia.\nAssociate Professor Li mBee Gim is\nthe chi ef executive office ro f\nFoodPlant.
