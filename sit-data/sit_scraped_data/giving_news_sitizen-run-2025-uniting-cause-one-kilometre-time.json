    "SITizen Run 2025: Uniting for a Cause, One Kilometre at a Time",
    "Runing and raising funds – 5,863km of fun, fitness and community giving!",
    "26 March 2025",
    "(Photos: Keng Photography)",
    "An impressive 5,863km – was clocked in our first-ever SITizen Run! Over 11 days, 14 to 24 February 2025, nearly 300 students, alumni and staff ran, walked and jogged to achieve this milestone while raising funds for the SIT Bursary.",
    "Well done, SITizens!",
    "Participants taking part in SIT Running Club’s shuttle run challenge.",
    "(Photos: Keng Photography)",
    "A fun-filled day at SITizen Run Carnival",
    "A highlight was the SITizen Run Carnival, which was held at our new Punggol Campus on 22 February. With blue skies and a cool morning breeze, excitement filled the air as the SIT Running Club led a warm-up session before the 5km run commenced.",
    "Mr Marc Chan, Director of the Advancement Office (AO) (right most),",
    "flagged off the first group of runners, followed by",
    "Mr Lawrenz Sim, Director of the Office of SITizen Experience (OSE) (second from right),",
    "for the second wave.",
    "(Photos: Keng Photography)",
    "Starting near Foodgle Hub at SIT Campus Court, the run brought participants down the scenic Punggol Promenade Punggol Point Walk, offering beautiful views of Coney Island and the waterfront, before looping back at Marina Country Club to the campus.",
    "First to cross the finish line was avid marathoner Mr Alan Poh (left), followed closely by Class of 2022 alumnus Mr Tan Yong Huay (Telematics) (right).",
    "(Photos: Keng Photography)",
    "Many students turned up in groups, spurring each other on, while alumni like Mr Tan took the opportunity to catch up with old friends. Staff also joined in the fun, such as Ms Betty Ong from SITLearn, who enjoyed bonding with two colleagues.",
    "Our beloved mascot OTi the Otter, was also there to cheer everyone on!",
    "(Photos: Keng Photography)",
    "Youngest!",
    "(Photos: Keng Photography)",
    "The inaugural event had some special participants! Our youngest, Raphael Wong, had just turned one a week before the event. His parents - Assistant Professor Nicholas Wong (Infocomm Technology cluster) (left, carrying Raphael) and his wife, Amy (middle) - took turns carrying him along the run.",
    "An avid runner who once completed a 10km run to raise awareness for Tourette’s Syndrome, Asst Prof Wong shared, “It feels very good when you are running for something meaningful.”",
    "Furriest!",
    "(Photos: Keng Photography)",
    "An adorable first - we had our first furry participant, Finn the Bearr, a 9-year-old chow chow-poodle mix! Finn stole the show, attracting many admirers as he trotted alongside owners Mr Lionel Wee and SIT alumna Ms Joanna Lee (Class of 2022, Air Transport Management), who was thrilled to visit the new campus.",
    "\"I love that the new campus is surrounded by nature. It's wonderful! It is a good initiative to bring everyone together, and I'm comforted knowing that it's for a good cause,\" said Ms Lee, who volunteers with non-profits and pet shelters.",
    "The half-day event had something for everyone. Passionate runners on an adrenaline high took on a shuttle run challenge organised by the SIT Running Club for a chance to win a Starbucks gift card.",
    "The carnival was also a hit – with delicious finger food and drinks galore, such as corn cups, ice cream, hot dogs, as well as refreshing isotonic slushies and Milo.",
    "Games and activities also kept the energy high with basketball shootouts, claw machines, caricature sketches and complimentary photo booths to capture the memories. Participants could also snap creative photos and post them on Instagram to win prizes.",
    "(Photos: Keng Photography)",
    "Thank you for making it happen!",
    "We are glad you had fun! The event organisers, OSE and AO, together with supporting partner SIT Running Club, would like to thank YOU for your participation. Stay tuned for next year’s SITizen Run!",
