  "content": "SINGAPORE’S first ocean basin fa-\ncility for simulating real-world\nocean operating environments\nopened on Tuesday (Jul 26).\nThrough industry partnerships, it\nwill co-create, stress-test and vali-\ndate solutions to challenges in the\nmarine and offshore engineering\nsector ,a sw ell as novel concepts of\nfuture ocean systems and infras-\ntructure.\nThe facility was opened by the\nTechnology Centre for Offshore\nand Marine, Singapore (TCOMS), a\nnational research and develop-\nment (R&D) centre set up by the\nAgency for Science, Technology\nand Research (A*Star) and the Na-\ntional University of Singapore\n(NUS).\nTCOMS is supported by the Sin-\ngapore Economic Development\nBoard and the Maritime &Port Au-\nthority of Singapore.The facility was previously slat-\ned for completion in 20 19,but was\ndelayed by the pandemic.\nIts ocean basin has an effective\ntest area of 60 by 48 mandavaria-\nble depth of up to 12m, holding\nenough water for 15Olympic-sized\nswimming pools.\nIt can simulate operating envi-\nronment si ns hallow ,intermediate\nand deep waters.\nAt the centre is a5 0m -deep pit –\n“one of the deepest in the world”,\nsaid TCOMS –allowing the simula-\ntion of ultra-deepwater environ-\nments of up to 3,000 m.\nA180 fla p-type wa ve-genera-\ntion system ca ngenerate waves up\nto1mhigh, while 6layers of flow\ncontrol allow the simulation of\ncomplex water-current flows.\nThe facility also has a2,500 kg\ncapacity towing carriage and a\nmovabl efloor.\nThese simulations enabl ere-\nsearchers to understand complex\nmarine environments and validateand enhance the design and per-\nformance of thei rsolutions.\nSembcorp Marine, for example,\nis working to bring floating wind\nturbines further offshore —t o5 00km from the coastline, where\nstronger winds can increase the\namount of energy generated. It\nsigned an agreement with TCOMS\nto “elevate the technology readin-essformarketing by carrying out\nvalidation tests” on its floating\nwind turbines, said senior manag-\ner of R&D Jason Chia.\nThe new facility can integrate\nwind and waves to realistically\nmimic the environment, unlike tra-\nditional facilities where waves and\nwind are tested separately ,h ea dd-\ned.\nSenior Minister and Coordinat-\ning Minister for National Security\nTeoChee Hean ,who attended the\nopening virtually ,said that TCOMS\nwill be akey part of Singapore’s\nR&D efforts in ocean engineering,\ntaking the lead in catalysing inno-\nvation as well as building partner-\nships an dlong-term capabilities.\nThe marin eand offshore engi-\nneering sector is important and\nrapidly evolving, with more than\n80 per cent of the world trade car-\nried by sea, and more than 90 per\ncent of the world’s communica-\ntions travelling via fibre optic sub-\nmarine cables, he added.New technologies are needed to\nmake the oceans more accessible\nasasustainab le resource fo rener-\ngy,transportation, food, minerals\nand as ahabitat ,h en oted.\nTCOMS lead samulti-institution\nresearch programme comprising\nA*Star ,local universities and in-\ndustry players Keppel Offshore &\nMarine and Sembcorp Marine, and\nhas established partnerships with\noverseas research institutes.\nAmong its partners is the Singa-\npore Institute of Technology ,with\nwhich i taims to build long-term ca-\npabilities and grow Singapore’s\npool of professionals, making the\nocean basin available for students’\nlearning.\nFrederick Chew ,A*Star’s chief ex-\necutive officer ,said: “The TCOMS\ntriple-helix collaboration between\nacademia, public sector and indus-\ntry enables co-innovating of solu-\ntions for the marine and offshore\nengineering, maritime and other\nocean-related sectors.”ByElysia Tan\nelysiat@sph.com.sg\nTheocean basi nfacility has an effective test area of 60 mb y4 8ma nd a\nvariable depth of up to12m.
