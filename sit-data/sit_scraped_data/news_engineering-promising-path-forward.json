    "Engineering a Promising Path Forward",
    "Inspired by her father’s dedication to his business of aircon servicing, Amber Seh En Ru embarked on her engineering journey at the Singapore Institute of Technology. She reflects on the opportunities that have shaped her journey towards a future in civil engineering.",
    "Amber Seh En Ru is a recipient of the SIT Scholarship. She is currently a Year 2 student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering at SIT.(Photo: BrightSparks)",
    "From a young age, Amber Seh En Ru developed an interest in engineering while assisting her father with air-conditioning service jobs during school holidays. She witnessed firsthand the dedication and passion he brought to his work. His ability to build lasting relationships with clients through trust and respect also left a lasting impression on her.",
    "“I gained insights into not just the technical aspects of engineering but also the importance of communication, engagement and rapport-building,” she reflected. These early experiences fueled her ambition to lead her own engineering projects.",
    "Taking the Leap of Faith",
    "However, Amber’s path to engineering wasn’t linear. Initially venturing into optometry as it was quite a popular course, she quickly realised it didn’t align with her true aspirations. Driven by a desire to make a more meaningful impact, Amber took a leap of faith and applied for a Civil Engineering degree jointly offered by SIT and the University of Glasgow.",
    "This decision not only led to Amber’s admission to SIT but also resulted in her being awarded the SIT Scholarship. SIT takes a unique approach by evaluating candidates for both admission and scholarships concurrently, eliminating the need for separate applications. This allows deserving students like Amber to receive their scholarship offer alongside their admission based on qualities such as commitment, integrity, passion, leadership, and the potential to embody the SITizen-DNA.",
    "“The scholarship has relieved the financial burden on my family,” Amber shared. “Without the worry of tuition fees, I’ve been able to focus fully on my studies and engage in various extracurricular activities that broaden my horizons.”",
    "Beyond academics, Amber has embraced opportunities to grow outside the classroom. One of her most enriching experiences has been her involvement in the SIT Motorcycle Club, which has become more than just a place to share her passion for riding. “Motorcycling gives me a sense of freedom and adventure—whether it’s a late-night ride to grab supper or a leisurely cruise to clear my mind,” she explained. Through the club, Amber has forged lasting friendships, found effective ways to de-stress from academic pressures, and participated in activities beyond riding, such as sports and community events. “Meeting people from all walks of life has enriched my perspective and made my student life more vibrant,” she added.",
    "The SIT Scholarship has also opened doors to new opportunities, connecting Amber with like-minded peers and providing her access to leadership workshops and networking events. For instance, Amber was able to develop her public speaking skills through her role as an emcee. She was also part of a Q&A panel for a tea session with prospective SIT students, which boosted her confidence to address large audiences.",
    "Connecting Theory to Practice",
    "The Civil Engineering programme at SIT blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience, a combination Amber believes is essential for success in the ever-evolving construction field. “The SIT curriculum combines theoretical knowledge with practical application, ensuring that students are well-prepared for real-world challenges,” Amber explained.",
    "Amber has already applied her learning to real-world projects, such as designing an airport system model from scratch during her overseas immersion programme at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. Immersed in a new environment, she was challenged to think creatively and adapt to unfamiliar settings— skills that will be crucial in her future career.",
    "“Working with fellow SIT teammates from different disciplines such as computer science, we tackled everything from floor plans and flight schedules to runway calculations and environmental considerations like carbon dioxide emissions,” she said. Her team’s innovative solution earned them an award for originality, a certificate, and a medal for their efforts.",
    "Building a Bright Future",
    "Amber Seh. (Photo: BrightSparks)",
    "With her sights set on a career in civil engineering, Amber aspires to make a positive impact through infrastructure development. “I hope to contribute to society by improving infrastructure and seeing tangible results from my efforts,” she enthused. “I want to be part of projects that make a positive impact on communities.”",
    "Amber plans to leverage her communication skills and technical expertise to excel in project management, ensuring that every project she works on leaves a lasting, positive mark.",
    "Amber encourages those considering a degree at SIT to take the leap. “SIT’s applied learning focus provides a fast-tracked path to entering the workforce, with longer work attachments that offer deeper industry insights,” she shared. “The strong partnerships with industry leaders and the hands-on approach to learning give students a headstart in their careers. If you’re looking for a dynamic, industry-focused education, SIT is the place to be!”",

She reflects on the opportunities that have shaped her journey towards a future in civil engineering.\nAmber Seh En Ru is a recipient of the SIT Scholarship. She is currently a Year 2 student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering at SIT.(Photo: BrightSparks)\nFrom a young age, Amber Seh En Ru developed an interest in engineering while assisting her father with air-conditioning service jobs during school holidays. She witnessed firsthand the dedication and passion he brought to his work. His ability to build lasting relationships with clients through trust and respect also left a lasting impression on her.\n“I gained insights into not just the technical aspects of engineering but also the importance of communication, engagement and rapport-building,” she reflected. These early experiences fueled her ambition to lead her own engineering projects.\nTaking the Leap of Faith\nHowever, Amber’s path to engineering wasn’t linear. Initially venturing into optometry as it was quite a popular course, she quickly realised it didn’t align with her true aspirations. Driven by a desire to make a more meaningful impact, Amber took a leap of faith and applied for a Civil Engineering degree jointly offered by SIT and the University of Glasgow.\nThis decision not only led to Amber’s admission to SIT but also resulted in her being awarded the SIT Scholarship. SIT takes a unique approach by evaluating candidates for both admission and scholarships concurrently, eliminating the need for separate applications. This allows deserving students like Amber to receive their scholarship offer alongside their admission based on qualities such as commitment, integrity, passion, leadership, and the potential to embody the SITizen-DNA.\n“The scholarship has relieved the financial burden on my family,” Amber shared. “Without the worry of tuition fees, I’ve been able to focus fully on my studies and engage in various extracurricular activities that broaden my horizons.”\nBeyond academics, Amber has embraced opportunities to grow outside the classroom. One of her most enriching experiences has been her involvement in the SIT Motorcycle Club, which has become more than just a place to share her passion for riding. “Motorcycling gives me a sense of freedom and adventure—whether it’s a late-night ride to grab supper or a leisurely cruise to clear my mind,” she explained. Through the club, Amber has forged lasting friendships, found effective ways to de-stress from academic pressures, and participated in activities beyond riding, such as sports and community events. “Meeting people from all walks of life has enriched my perspective and made my student life more vibrant,” she added.\nThe SIT Scholarship has also opened doors to new opportunities, connecting Amber with like-minded peers and providing her access to leadership workshops and networking events. For instance, Amber was able to develop her public speaking skills through her role as an emcee. She was also part of a Q&A panel for a tea session with prospective SIT students, which boosted her confidence to address large audiences.\nConnecting Theory to Practice\nThe Civil Engineering programme at SIT blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience, a combination Amber believes is essential for success in the ever-evolving construction field. “The SIT curriculum combines theoretical knowledge with practical application, ensuring that students are well-prepared for real-world challenges,” Amber explained.\nAmber has already applied her learning to real-world projects, such as designing an airport system model from scratch during her overseas immersion programme at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. Immersed in a new environment, she was challenged to think creatively and adapt to unfamiliar settings— skills that will be crucial in her future career.\n“Working with fellow SIT teammates from different disciplines such as computer science, we tackled everything from floor plans and flight schedules to runway calculations and environmental considerations like carbon dioxide emissions,” she said. Her team’s innovative solution earned them an award for originality, a certificate, and a medal for their efforts.\nBuilding a Bright Future\nAmber Seh. (Photo: BrightSparks)\nWith her sights set on a career in civil engineering, Amber aspires to make a positive impact through infrastructure development. “I hope to contribute to society by improving infrastructure and seeing tangible results from my efforts,” she enthused. “I want to be part of projects that make a positive impact on communities.”\nAmber plans to leverage her communication skills and technical expertise to excel in project management, ensuring that every project she works on leaves a lasting, positive mark.\nAmber encourages those considering a degree at SIT to take the leap. “SIT’s applied learning focus provides a fast-tracked path to entering the workforce, with longer work attachments that offer deeper industry insights,” she shared. “The strong partnerships with industry leaders and the hands-on approach to learning give students a headstart in their careers. If you’re looking for a dynamic, industry-focused education, SIT is the place to be!”\nThis article first appeared on\nBrightSparks\n.\nTopics\nEngineering\nSITizen\nSITizen Ambassador\nscholarship\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nEngineering\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nEngineering the Future: Giving Students a Head Start in the Corporate World\nview\nNext\n3D-Printing: Crafting a Competitive Edge\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences"
