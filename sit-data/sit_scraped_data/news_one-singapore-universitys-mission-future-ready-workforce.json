    "One Singapore University's Mission for a Future-Ready Workforce",
    "Shakespeare would have it that all the world’s a stage. But it could also be a giant classroom.",
    "The best learning includes experiences outside of the campus, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) believes. It has designed its student experience to tear down the walls of the lecture hall, and place undergraduates right in the heat of the action — in the industry.",
    "SIT students go through work attachment programmes and receive learning credits to further their knowledge after graduation. Here’s how the university is giving its students a head-start to employment.",
    "Real world insights",
    "Tan An Qi, a recent Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering graduate at SIT. She is part of the SGUnited Traineeships Programme at Siemens Advance Manufacturing Transformation Centre (AMTC).",
    "SIT deliberately crafts its curriculum to give students a taste of the real working world, and emphasises the need to be lifelong learners and stay agile in a disruptive era.",
    "Tan An Qi",
    ", a recent",
    "Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering",
    "graduate, shares how her university experience helped hone both her skillsets and a growth mindset.",
    "During her attachment at leading industrial and fiber laser solutions supplier Coherent, An Qi led a research project to design and build a thermal chamber. The process taught her to prioritise practicality.",
    "After coming up with the initial designs for the thermal chamber, a senior colleague shared with her that it may be a bit too heavy for just one staff to handle, she says. Another important lesson was that there was no need to customise everything — sometimes it is faster and cheaper to buy ready-made parts.",
    "It is with these insights from experienced industry seniors that An Qi realised the importance of keeping an open mind to cultivate a growth mindset and not limit her personal and professional growth.",
    "This experience came in helpful for her current role under the SGUnited Traineeships Programme at Siemens Advance Manufacturing Transformation Centre (AMTC). When she’s not creating digital twin models of manufacturing plants, she assists with the operation of specialised equipment and trains mid-career switchers – all of which are new experiences that cannot be taught in the classroom.",
    "“It was certainly daunting to graduate amid a pandemic. However, my academic experience had helped nurture a sense of adaptability, and I jumped at the opportunity to apply for the traineeship role at Siemens when I saw the opening on ReadyTalent – SIT’s job portal for students,” says An Qi.",
    "Her supervisor has also found her university experience useful. Her academic training “was a good foundation to work on”, says",
    "Mr",
    "Benjamin Moey, Vice President of Advance Manufacturing and Head of Advance Manufacturing Transformation Centre, Digital Industries, ASEAN, Siemens",
    ". “I believe some of the courses have given her the opportunity to develop important soft skills, such as communications and problem solving,” Moey adds.",
    "An Qi has since been offered a full-time role at Siemens AMTC.",
    "Unlearning and relearning",
    "Technology is constantly evolving and transforming the sectors, and the workforce needs to keep up. SIT offers learning credits for graduates, who can use these to learn about the latest industry advancements.",
    "These credits were of great help to",
    "Timothy Lee Zi Jia",
    ", a recent",
    "Electrical Power Engineering",
    "graduate. At his full-time job as an electrical engineer, he manages more than 500 components that are crucial to manufacturing operations.",
    "One popular solution in the industry now is to use machine learning to predict the lifespan of a machine or preempt a failure, he shares. Through SITLEARN Professional Development’s machine learning course, he learned how to apply the same approach to the tools under his care.",
    "Career matchmaker",
    "“Our emphasis on applied learning encourages students to learn by doing, rather than learning for doing, which helps them to be industry-relevant and employable,” says",
    "Ms Yeo May-Fung, Director, Centre for Career Readiness, SIT",
    ".",
    "The university has been leveraging its strong industry partnerships to help final-year students in their job search. SIT holds workshops with companies, offers recruitment recommendations and sets up networking opportunities for students.",
    "“We constantly connect with key members of the industry to understand how we can strengthen the talent pipeline to help address the gaps in their sectors. By doing so, we ensure that there will be a demand for our students when they graduate,” she adds.",
    "Graduating students will have to grapple with a volatile job market for the next few years, as the economy recovers. SIT’s emphasis on real world experience, continuous learning and career support will help to give students a leg up into the world of work.",

But it could also be a giant classroom.\nThe best learning includes experiences outside of the campus, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) believes. It has designed its student experience to tear down the walls of the lecture hall, and place undergraduates right in the heat of the action — in the industry.\nSIT students go through work attachment programmes and receive learning credits to further their knowledge after graduation. Here’s how the university is giving its students a head-start to employment.\nReal world insights\nTan An Qi, a recent Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering graduate at SIT. She is part of the SGUnited Traineeships Programme at Siemens Advance Manufacturing Transformation Centre (AMTC).\nSIT deliberately crafts its curriculum to give students a taste of the real working world, and emphasises the need to be lifelong learners and stay agile in a disruptive era.\nTan An Qi\n, a recent\nMechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering\ngraduate, shares how her university experience helped hone both her skillsets and a growth mindset.\nDuring her attachment at leading industrial and fiber laser solutions supplier Coherent, An Qi led a research project to design and build a thermal chamber. The process taught her to prioritise practicality.\nAfter coming up with the initial designs for the thermal chamber, a senior colleague shared with her that it may be a bit too heavy for just one staff to handle, she says. Another important lesson was that there was no need to customise everything — sometimes it is faster and cheaper to buy ready-made parts.\nIt is with these insights from experienced industry seniors that An Qi realised the importance of keeping an open mind to cultivate a growth mindset and not limit her personal and professional growth.\nThis experience came in helpful for her current role under the SGUnited Traineeships Programme at Siemens Advance Manufacturing Transformation Centre (AMTC). When she’s not creating digital twin models of manufacturing plants, she assists with the operation of specialised equipment and trains mid-career switchers – all of which are new experiences that cannot be taught in the classroom.\n“It was certainly daunting to graduate amid a pandemic. However, my academic experience had helped nurture a sense of adaptability, and I jumped at the opportunity to apply for the traineeship role at Siemens when I saw the opening on ReadyTalent – SIT’s job portal for students,” says An Qi.\nHer supervisor has also found her university experience useful. Her academic training “was a good foundation to work on”, says\nMr\nBenjamin Moey, Vice President of Advance Manufacturing and Head of Advance Manufacturing Transformation Centre, Digital Industries, ASEAN, Siemens\n. “I believe some of the courses have given her the opportunity to develop important soft skills, such as communications and problem solving,” Moey adds.\nAn Qi has since been offered a full-time role at Siemens AMTC.\nUnlearning and relearning\nTechnology is constantly evolving and transforming the sectors, and the workforce needs to keep up. SIT offers learning credits for graduates, who can use these to learn about the latest industry advancements.\nThese credits were of great help to\nTimothy Lee Zi Jia\n, a recent\nElectrical Power Engineering\ngraduate. At his full-time job as an electrical engineer, he manages more than 500 components that are crucial to manufacturing operations.\nOne popular solution in the industry now is to use machine learning to predict the lifespan of a machine or preempt a failure, he shares. Through SITLEARN Professional Development’s machine learning course, he learned how to apply the same approach to the tools under his care.\nCareer matchmaker\n“Our emphasis on applied learning encourages students to learn by doing, rather than learning for doing, which helps them to be industry-relevant and employable,” says\nMs Yeo May-Fung, Director, Centre for Career Readiness, SIT\n.\nThe university has been leveraging its strong industry partnerships to help final-year students in their job search. SIT holds workshops with companies, offers recruitment recommendations and sets up networking opportunities for students.\n“We constantly connect with key members of the industry to understand how we can strengthen the talent pipeline to help address the gaps in their sectors. By doing so, we ensure that there will be a demand for our students when they graduate,” she adds.\nGraduating students will have to grapple with a volatile job market for the next few years, as the economy recovers. SIT’s emphasis on real world experience, continuous learning and career support will help to give students a leg up into the world of work.\nThis article first appeared in\nGovInsider\n.\nTopics\nFeatures\nApplied Learning\nIndustry\nAlumni\nEmployment\nIntegrated Work Study Programme\nIndustry Immersions\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nEngineering\nIndustry & Community\nSITizens & Campus\nAcademic Clusters\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nLean Thinking: Spurring Creativity at Shalom Movers\nview\nNext\nFarming at Your Doorstep\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
