    "Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) is a formalised specialist method for calculating numerical individual, societal, (employee and public) risk level values for comparison with regulatory risk criteria.",
    "Satisfactory demonstration of acceptable risk levels is often a requirement for approval of major hazard plant construction plans, including transmission pipelines, offshore platforms and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage and import sites.",
    "Each demonstration must be reviewed periodically to show that risks are controlled and reduced to an acceptable level according to applicable legislation and internal company governance requirements. Risk evaluation can also help the decision-making process, in comparing the risks involved in alternative processes or layouts, and optimising expenditure to improve safety.",
    "QRA helps to identify and evaluate possible accidental events, including their causes and consequences, and provides a basis for emergency preparedness and land use planning.",
    "Modelling of consequences from major hazard such as fires, explosions and toxic clouds is an important part of risk assessments and is normally done by applying a wide range of models, from low-complexity empirical models to advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models.",
