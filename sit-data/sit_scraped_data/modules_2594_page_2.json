    "Physiotherapy\n Modules",
    "Year 3 (Trimester 1)",
    "Honours Thesis Proposal",
    "PTY3803",
    "Students will be required to submit a research proposal and an ethics application which is related to their honours thesis. The module aims to develop the core research skill of formulating a research question and designing an appropriate methodology after a critical review of the literature (that has exposed gaps or limitations in the literature). It also aims to help students learn about the importance of ethics in health science research.",
    "Professionalism, Ethics and the Law",
    "HSC3006",
    "This module focuses on the professional, ethical and legal drivers of health professional practice. It explores the conceptualization of professionalism of the health professionals in terms of identity, the work they perform and autonomy. Students learn various ethical theories from both the West and the East, incorporating these in case-based learning activities that also stimulate and chart their moral development. Specific ethical issues such as informed consent, confidentiality, sanctity of life and end-of-life issues, and many others, are discussed. Pertinent local healthcare laws as they relate to the professional and ethical conduct of health care professionals as well as health services provision will be examined in the context of professional and ethical practice. This module is intended for students from various health sciences disciplines so that interprofessional learning about professional and ethical issues can be achieved.",
    "Scientific Writing and Investigation",
    "PTY3004",
    "Overall the aim of this module is enable the student to carry out successful research in a particular field, through the review, synthesis, and evaluation of literature. This module builds on the Research Methods and Statistics Module in Year 2. This module concentrates on the effective presentation of research literature in the form of two literature reviews.",
    "Critical Care Physiotherapy",
    "PTY3008",
    "The module focuses on the concepts of critical care related to multi-organ/ system function and dysfunction, and holistic care relating to physiology, assessment, pathophysiology, system failure and clinical management of the body systems. Core concepts of complex pathophysiology, current treatment modalities, and physiotherapist’s roles in critically ill patients will be discussed. Specific clinical and professional issues relating to the critical care environment will also be addressed.",
    "Clinical Decision Making in Patients with Complex Health Issues",
    "PTY3019",
    "The module builds on the two previous years by revisiting the core areas of physiotherapy practice (musculoskeletal, respiratory and neurology) through a case based approach. New material is introduced in order to support the integration of knowledge from all practice areas to addressing the complexity of treating and managing multi-factorial health issues across all areas of health care from hospital to long term care to home. Specific clinical and professional issues and patient-centred care will be addressed. The aim of this module is to facilitate the integration of different areas of physiotherapy knowledge and skills into the management of patients with multiple health needs. The module focuses on the development of clinical reasoning skills for clients with complex and multiple problems using an evidence based approach to patient care in different settings. The module will address the evaluation of the efficacy of the physiotherapy interventions and the application in patient centred care. The cases will reflect contemporary healthcare demands and needs, and so may change from year to year.",
    "Neurological Physiotherapy 3",
    "PTY3017",
    "This module provides the learners with a framework for the assessment and treatment of people with more complex neurological conditions that require specialized knowledge and skills. These conditions include vestibular conditions, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. Clinical reasoning and practical skills will be covered based on motor learning and motor control principles.",
    "Honours Thesis Preparation",
    "PTY3801",
    "The aim of the module is to facilitate the students to actively participate in a research process, and in so doing understand the theoretical and practical aspects of research. The module aims to develop a solid appreciation of the value of research in clinical practice. It aims to encourage ongoing critical evaluation in clinical practice.",
    "Year 3 (Trimester 2)",
    "Physiotherapy across Lifespan",
    "PTY3015",
    "The module aims to prepare the student as a competent entry-level physiotherapist to help different populations across the lifespan achieve functional independence. Life span issues will be explored within the framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Focus is given to students developing a clear understanding of typical development and the potential influences upon development in the neuromotor, musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary body systems.  The impact of congenital or acquired conditions or lifestyle diseases causing dysfunction in one or more of these systems will also be introduced. Students will gain an understanding on the role of physiotherapy in managing the unique health concerns in  paediatric, adolescent, women’s and men’s health and older person populations. Ageing and growing older will be introduced from both a sociological and rehabilitation perspective. Attitudes to ageing and to older adults are explored as well as the conditions encountered in later life.",
