    "Development of Coachscrew Patrolling Tool",
    "This video showcases the design and development of an effective coachscrew patrolling tool for inspecting coachscrews quickly and safely. This tool won the SMRT Most Innovative Kaizen Project Awards 2023.",

    "Enhanced Thermal Proofing Capability of Train Cabins",
    "Climate change is causing global temperature to rise, and Singapore is especially affected due to the urban heat island effect. Inefficient use of energy in train stations contributes to global warming which further increases in ambient temperatures, leading to a vicious cycle. This project designs a low-energy solution to cool train cabins by 1.0 to 1.5 degrees, reducing the load on existing cooling systems.",

    "Green E-Bike Hub",
    "With the current pandemic, there has been an increase of delivery riders due to demand for food orders. The project designs a shelter powered through renewable energy sources for E-bike riders and commuters, providing charging capabilities for E-bikes and concurrently creating designated lots for E-bike riders to park.",

    "Engineering Systems",
    "Automatic Continuous 3rd Rail Structural Gauge",
    "The 3rd rail structural gauging is a preventive maintenance task performed to ensure that the 3rd rail structure is within tolerance in order not to cause damage to the trains’ current collector shoes. This project proves the concept that the 3rd rail structural gauging can be continuously conducted and can possibly detect tunnel features that are close enough to the gauge to cause damage upon impact.",

    "Engineering Systems",
    "Designing and Prototyping Emergency 3rd Rail Joint Clamp",
    "The 3rd rail joint is an essential component in the railway as it ensures that electricity passes through different sections of 3rd rails, as well as to sustain the alignment of the 3rd rails. This project designs and develops an emergency 3rd rail joint clamp to mitigate the issue of a 3rd rail joint break and concurrently maintain the alignment of the 3rd rail joint. The proposed emergency 3rd rail joint clamp also eases the workload of the maintenance team by reducing the time taken for recovery actions.",
