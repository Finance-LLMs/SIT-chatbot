    "In Singapore, all low-voltage electrical installations are required to comply with the provisions of the Singapore standard SS 638:2018 Code of Practice for Electrical Installations.",
    "This mandate is set by the Energy Market Authority to prioritise safety, particularly in guarding against electric shock and fire hazards related to electricity usage. The code primarily concerns the design, selection, erection, inspection, and testing of these electrical installations.",
    "This three-day course provides an in-depth understanding of the requirements and provisions of SS 638:2018. Solar photovoltaic (PV) installations and the requirements of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure will also be covered.",
    "Learners can expect practical demonstrations showcasing the real-world application of these regulations using design examples. Moreover, the course will focus on imparting the skills needed to design electrical installations that prioritise safety, reliability, ease of maintenance, and energy efficiency. Learners will also receive a copy of SS 638:2018 worth S$147.40 during the course.",
