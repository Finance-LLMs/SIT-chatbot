    "Physiotherapy\n Modules",
    "Year 4 (Trimester 1)",
    "Honours Thesis",
    "PTY4801",
    "The aim of the module is to facilitate the students to actively participate in a research process, and in so doing understand the theoretical and practical aspects of research. The module aims to develop a solid appreciation of the value of research in clinical practice. It aims to encourage ongoing critical evaluation in clinical practice.",
    "Clinical Practice Education Year 4",
    "PTY4901",
    "The purpose of this course component is to provide the students with clinical experience and opportunities to develop clinical skills in areas such as cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, neurological, intermediate and long term care and selective specialised areas such as paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, and geriatrics. The clinical practice education will be conducted at different hospitals in Singapore across various healthcare settings. Students will spend six weeks at each clinical practice to develop the relevant physiotherapy competencies. Students will be posted to four core areas of physiotherapy setting (musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, neurological physiotherapy and intermediate long term care). An elective placement in a specialised area of physiotherapy will be included but this is subjected to availability and further approval by programme director. In total, the students will undergo five blocks of clinical practice education. All clinical placements are supervised by one or more trained clinical tutors/supervisors.",
    "Year 4 (Trimester 2)",
    "Professional and Interprofessional Education",
    "PTY4002",
    "This module explores the conceptualization of professionalism of the health professionals with respect to identity, the work they perform and autonomy. Both occupational and organizational professionalism will be discussed in the context of the new public managerialism. Besides developing theoretical foundation on understanding professionalism, representatives from the respective health professional associations and bodies will be invited to share with students the importance of membership with professional associations and their advocacy work. Students learn various ethical theories from both the West and the East, and incorporate these in case-based learning activities that also stimulate and chart their moral development. Pertinent healthcare laws locally as they relate to the professional and ethical conduct of health care professionals as well as health services provision will be integrated throughout the module. This module is intended for students from various health sciences disciplines so that interprofessional learning about professional and ethical issues can be achieved.",
    "Global Health",
    "HSC4009",
    "This interprofessional module provides the opportunity for students to expand their knowledge and understanding of contemporary global health issues. Students will have opportunity to independently identify and develop in-depth knowledge about a specific global health issue. Students will learn the major challenges and issues in global health, such as double burden of diseases, Sustainable Development Goals, primary health care, climate change, health diplomacy and many others. Communicable diseases including vaccine-preventable diseases, the ‘big three’, neglected tropical diseases and emerging infectious diseases will be covered. Noncommunicable diseases focus on cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and diabetes.",
