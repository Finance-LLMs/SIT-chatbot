Some people use\nhard disks, social media platforms\nor cloud storage systems, or a com-\nbination of these.\nDr Jiow Hee Jhee, a member of\nthe Media Literacy Council and a fa-\nther of four, suggests that parents\norganise photos in a way that is\nmeaningful for them.\nThe associate professor and pro-\ngramme leader at the Singapore In-\nstitute  of  Technology  says:  “It\nlargely depends  on  the  person’s\npreference and lifestyle.\n“For example, I archive certain\nmemorable events of my children,\nsuch as when they receive a presti-\ngious award, on my hard drive, al-\nthough it is also posted on social\nmedia.”\nHere are other tips to consider\nwhen storing  digital  photos  and\nvideos.\n1Regularly back up\nand declutter\nAt least once a year – more, if she\ntravels  or  changes  her  mobile\nphone – Ms Janice Choong does a\n“system  dump”,  downloading  all\nthe photos and videos on her smart-\nphone into an external hard disk.\nEven  videos  posted  on  TikTok\nmake the cut.\nWhen  the  40-year-old  is  free,\nshe curates the ones she wishes to\nsave into a second hard disk, leav-\ning out images such as photos of\nmeals or outfits.\nShe sorts the images in this sec-\nond hard disk into detailed folders\nthat contain photos of her 11-year-\nold son, Kayden, as well as folders\nfor each of her three dogs – two\nWesties (West Highland White Ter-\nriers) and a Maltipoo (a cross be-\ntween a Maltese and a poodle).\nThe finance manager in the infor-\nmation technology sector started or-\nganising the footage in April, before\nand after travelling to Italy. This en-\nsured  her  photos  from  that  trip\nwere quickly placed into safe stor-\nage. She also worries she might lose\nher mobile phone while overseas.The process can take a few days\nif there are glitches in download-\ning, but it is worth the effort know-\ning that the precious memories are\nsafe, she says.\nMs Chong says losing all the pho-\ntos on her phone would be a “night-\nmare”.\n2Have specific labels\nMs Angeline Yeh, 29, organises\nher digital trove via Google Photos,\na cloud-based tool that can store\nphotos, videos and screenshots.\n“I organise them by date or occa-\nsion,  but  sometimes,  the  dates\ndon’t  mean  anything,”  says  Ms\nYeh, a chief marketing officer in\nthe bio-technology sector. She has\na  nine-year-old  daughter  and  a\none-year-old son.\nShe further organises the footage\nin sub-folders to mark milestones\nsuch as birthdays, as well as more\nmundane events such as playdates.\n3Make full use of platform\nfeatures\nGoogle and other cloud storage sys-\ntems have features that go beyond\nstoring  footage  automatically  by\ndate and can be synced across dif-\nferent devices.\nGoogle Singapore’s Lucian Teo,\nprogram  manager,  Google.org,\nsays: “Videos and photos stored on\nGoogle Photos can be searched by\npeople,  places,  and  even  things\nand activities. We no longer have\nto spend time tagging, labelling im-\nages or creating photo albums.”\nThe new “import photos” feature\nmakes it easy to copy photos from\nother services, or digitise photos,\nvideos and film, he says.\nThe app can also remove clutter\nfrom one’s photo feed, such as im-\nages  of  receipts  or  presentation\nslides. He suggests streamlining al-bums with the app’s “Archive” but-\nton and archival suggestions.\n4Share photos\nMr Teo suggests using Google\nPhotos to set up shared albums to\nhelp organise digital photos.\nHe says: “If you’re going on a big-\nger family trip, you can consider\ncreating and sharing collaborative\nalbums  so  multiple  people  can\nshare their photos instantly.”\nThe Google Nest Hub, a smart-\nhome  hub  which  comes  with  a\ntouchscreen display that can con-\ntrol other smart-home devices, dis-\nplays an automatically created feed\nthat allows his parents to view pho-\ntos of their grandchildren, he says.\nApple’s iCloud Photos also keeps\nimages up to date spanning differ-\nent devices.\nIts Photos app includes a “For\nYou” tab that searches photos and\nvideos to find moments that stand\nout. It then presents them in collec-\ntions  called  “Memories”.  It  also\nprompts ideas for adding effects to\nselected photos, and finds “Shar-\ning Suggestions”, which are collec-\ntions of photos that can be shared.\n5Use photos to bond\nwith your kids\nMr Chong Ee Jay, a cyber well-\nness  expert  from  Focus  on  the\nFamily Singapore, says organising\nand  sharing  family  photos  on\nsocial media has a similar bonding\neffect.\nHe says: “Social media presents\nopportunities for parents to easily\ncreate  digital  photo  albums  or\nscrapbooks by compiling photos.\n“It  also  presents  opportunities\nfor children to be involved in creat-\ning  family  moments  by  sharing\nphotos and videos on shared plat-\nforms.”Social media platforms have in-\nbuilt ways of organising  photos,\nand not only through chronologi-\ncal posts and highlights.\nThe TikTok app, for instance, has\nan option to download and save\nvideos directly onto a device. You\ncan also mark a TikTok video as a\nfavourite and it will be added to\nyour Favourites menu in the profile\npage to be viewed later, and TikTok\nFavourites  can  be  further  sorted\ninto  collections,  says  Ms  Doreen\nTan, user and content operations\nmanager at TikTok Singapore.\nGoing  old  school  and  printing\nphysical  copies  of  photographs\ncan also be useful.\nMs Carol Loi, founder of Village\nConsultancy, which provides digi-\ntal literacy education to families,\neducators,  youth  and  children,\nsays: “Printing out special photos\nin the form of a year book can help\nto build family heritage, especially\nwhen parents involve their chil-\ndren in compiling the photos, as\nwell as reflecting on the memories\nthey evoke.”\n6Be aware of ‘sharenting’\npitfalls\nInvolving children in sharing and\norganising media online typically\nrequires parents to be more inten-\ntional as the kids grow up.\nMs Yeh says she does not post\nmuch of her daughter now that the\nchild is older.\n“I’ll ask her first, ‘Do you think\nthis photo is okay?’” she adds.\nVillage  Consultancy’s  Ms  Loi\nsays: “Keeping photos as secure as\npossible and respecting children’s\nprivacy  should  be  considered\nregarding  organising  images  in-\nvolving children.”\nShe  advises  caution  when  it\ncomes to “sharenting”, or the use of social media to share images and\nnews of one’s children.\nMs Loi says: “Even when social\nmedia  settings  are  private,  we\nshould remember that whatever is\nput out should be considered pub-\nlic information. It is hard to take\ndown if it is used by other people. It\nalso makes it easier for others to\ntrack our children.\n“It would be useful for parents to\nput  themselves  in  their  child’s\nshoes. When he or she is older,\nhow would they feel when they see\nthemselves  in  their  parents’\nposts?”\nHaving  an  open  conversation\nwith older kids about their views\non personal data and information\nabout  them  will  avoid  potential\nmiscommunication, she adds.\n7Keep the big picture in mind\nSome parents find it helps to\nhave a larger purpose when regu-\nlarly updating their preferred sys-\ntem of archiving memories of their\nkids’ childhood.\nFreelance photographer Veron-\nica Ang hopes to transfer her Face-\nbook account to  her 15-year-old\nson, Reilly, in the future.\nThis particular private account,\nwhich is restricted to family mem-\nbers, contains photos and videos\nfrom when Reilly was born. It is or-\nganised  in  detail  –  month  by\nmonth in his younger years.\nWhen he is an adult, Reilly can\nalso have the hard disks that Ms\nAng, who is in her 40s, has backed\nup all this material in.\nMs  Ang,  who  is  married  to  a\n53-year-old foreign exchange bro-\nker, says: “Reilly can look back on\nthese memories next time. He can\nedit the images for his wedding too.”\nFor Ms Seah Jing, a talent man-\nager in the entertainment indus-\ntry, the act of organising and re-\ntrieving her only child’s photos\nand videos on Instagram can be\ncathartic.\nShe and her IT programmer hus-\nband, both 33, have a one-year-old\nson, Judah.\nMs Seah says: “Instagram is the\nnew photo album, I guess. My hus-\nband and I look back at my posts\nand we say, ‘How come our son\nwas that small?’”\nEven at the end of a long day,\nwhen she has had to deal with baby\ntantrums, she feels good posting In-\nstagram Stories of him.\nMs Seah now has 21,000 photos\non her smartphone, which are\nbacked up on Google Photos.\nShe describes her mobile with its\nvast collection as a “black hole”.\nShe says: “I take it easy and try\nnot to go overboard. As a parent of\na young child, I live day by day. As\nmuch as I want to archive every-\nthing, I also have to be present in\nthe moment.”\nvenessal@sph.com.sg Janice Choong sorts images into\ndetailed folders that contain photos\nof her son Kayden and each of her\nthree dogs.
