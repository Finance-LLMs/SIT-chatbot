    "Pump and piping networks are widely used in process industries and many other workplaces to transport liquid between different equipment and locations. It is critical to have reliable pumps and a piping network to ensure smooth operations.",
    "In the meantime, the pump system contributes a very big part to the utility cost. It is important to design and operate an optimal pump and piping network to run at their best efficiency points. Principle-based design, sizing, and selection process will ensure an efficient, lower-cost, and more reliable pump and piping system which requires less maintenance. This intensive course is targeted to energy professionals who have pre-requisite knowledge and work experience in energy efficiency technologies and aspire to upskill their competency in pump and piping systems.",
    "The main objectives of this 40-hour training programme are to enable participants:",
    "To gain in-depth knowledge of the theory and working principles of the pump and piping systems for various applications",
