    "Abstract",
    "In the context of education for process system engineering, the learning is always made more interesting and appealing by providing real-life examples, coupled with problem- or project-based learning (Abbas 2009). Recent development in computer-based learning (e.g. virtual process plant) has been well received and has aided learning in courses related to control and unit operations (Norton 2008). These teaching pedagogies have proven their efficacy in training chemical engineering graduates with high cognitive and problem-solving skills. However, there remains a gap in the training for industry-ready graduates: students should be given more opportunities to develop skills to solve every-day industrial problems in a cost-effective manner (El-Rarargy 2010). The ideal solution to bridge the gap would be a fully functioning industrial manufacturing plant, where students have full access to a variety of learning activities. But this is rarely achievable given the constraints on cost, time and space.",
    "An alternative is to use a model of the manufacturing plant as the basis for skill training. The model plant can be designed and built using 3D printing technology. For manufacturing plant producing active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), the major equipment (vessels, filters, driers, isolators, hydrogenator, condensers, receivers etc.) can be 3D printed. To mimic the operation, water flow can be enabled by incorporation of miniature pumps, motors, valves, etc. Using this plant as a basis, students can develop process flow diagram, propose plant modifications, implement modifications, and validate new processes. In addition, this model plant will be a good training ground for technology transfer (TT) of new chemical entities. Other than written problem-based exercises, having a physical model will equip students with additional skills, for example, tracing pipeline, surveying plant modifications constraints, investigating operational and people/material flows issues, etc. The model plant will be a self-sustainable teaching tool creates for the student and maintained/controlled as a cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) facility by the student.",
    "The efficiency of the 3D printed plant will be evaluated using a three-year evaluation plan, involving three cohorts of pharmaceutical engineering students in the cGMP course. The control group will run in Q4 2016, and the pedagogy will be roll out gradually from Q4 2017 onwards. For evaluation, students will be asked to do systematic investigation of cGMP deviations using the plant as a backdrop. Students are expected to trace the process lines in the 3D model, analyse all potential causes to the problem, and develop the root cause. The performance of the teaching pedagogy will be accessed via student-self and rubik skill sets assessments. The efficiency of the teaching model will be analysed using statistical test e.g. student’s t-test. Periodic feedback will also be collected via focus group discussions.",
    "To our knowledge, this is the first proposal that uses 3D model plant in engineering education. The development and implementation of the proposed teaching pedagogy will provide a fresh look into the practicability of conventional chemical engineering education and add value to produce industry-ready graduates.",
