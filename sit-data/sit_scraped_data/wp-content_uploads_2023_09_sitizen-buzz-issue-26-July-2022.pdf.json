CEO & Co-Founder. AMILi: Ms Toh Kai Yee. Head of\nlab and Research, AMIL!; Assoc Prof Susanna Leong. Vice President (Applied Research). SIT; and Prof Chua Kee Chaing, President, SIT\nThe Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), Singapore's University of Applied learning, and AMILi Pte Ltd, Southeast Asia's first\nprecision gut microbiome company, have formalised a three-year partnership on 3 June 2022 to accelerate innovations in human gut\nmicrobiome. SIT and AMILi will jointly embark on a series of research and development (R&D) programmes, staff upskilling initiatives,\nand work attachme nt opportunities for SIT students.\nCommercialising Kale Stems as Prebiotics through First-of-its-Kind R&D Programme\nAs the human gut microbiome research continues to be an important field to advance  human health, researchers from SIT and AMILi\nhave embarked on a research programme to exploit the benefits of leftover farmed vegetables for gut health improvement.  The first-of­\nits-kind applied research programme utilises food waste valorisation through drying and milling methodologies to optimise kale stems as\nprebiotics that will enhance the growth of probiotics, with a focus on the Asian population. Kale stems, in its powder form, are found to\nbe strong catalysts for the growth of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, both of which are essential intestinal bacteria that aid in the\nmaintenance of a healthy gut system.\nSIT will further develop kale stems as a prebiotic to be incorporated  into AMILI's next generation of gut health supplements.  Coupled\nwith AMILI's findings from its fast-growing  multi-ethnic microbiome  database, the new commercial product will present a competitive\nedge to existing Western formulations. AMILl's keen focus in Asian microbiome research and innovation enables the company to develop\nproducts and services that are based on comprehens ive studies of the gut microbiome and dietary patterns of people living in Asia.\nThe joint R&D in optimising kale stems as prebiotics is a continuation of SIT's work in food waste valorisation with home-grown agri-tech\ncompany Sustenir,  which produces healthy vegetables such as kale, lettuce and spinach.  Apart from the optimisatio n of kale stems as\nprebiotics, SIT and AMILi will also embark on other applied research initiatives that will contribute to leveraging technology pl atforms to\naccelerate the expansion of AMILI's gut health studies and suite of commercial offerings.\nIndustry Upskilling and Strengthening Talent Pipeline through Skills-Based Learning\nAs part of the collaboration, SIT and AMILi will employ a skills-based approach in a symbiotic staff exchange programme that aims to\nstrengthen industry and academia upskilling. SIT academic staff, comprising faculty and Professional Officers, will be closely engaged in\nAM Ill's product development efforts, while AMILl's staff will benefit from SIT's applied research expertise and laboratory contributions.\nBoth SIT and AMILi employees will also co-develop and incorporate topics on gut microbio me in future coursework.\nThere will also be work attachment opportunities for SIT students across multiple disciplines, including Food Technology,\nPharmace utical Engineering, and Dietetics and Nutrition. Students will gain real-world exposure through practical  sessions in applied\nresearch and commercial product development.\nSaid Associate Professor Susanna Leong, Vice President (Applied Research), SIT: \"One of SIT's key applied research  focus is sustainable\nfood innovation. We aim to contribute to the growing functional foods and nutraceutical market through sustainable R&D methodologies\nsuch as food waste valorisation. We look forward to working with AMILi to develop products that meets the needs of Asian consumers.\"\nDr Jeremy Lim, CEO & Co-Founder, AMILi, said: \"We are honoure d to partner SIT, a university that includes food science and innovation\nas one of their key areas of focus. As our tagline goes, 'Good health starts with gut health', and Asia has many traditional foods and\ningredients that are only just being scientifically  assessed to demonstrate their health benefits. We believe this partnership will be a key\nplatform to achieve this.\"\nPlease click� for the full story.\nPlant-based Protein Supplements - A\nTasty Alternative with an Asian\nFlavour\nBlack sesame, coffee, passionfruit, and mushroom soup -these familiar favourites have had their flavour and\nnutrition profiles harnessed to be consumed as a plant-based protein supplement for cancer patients.\nEl 01 July 2022\nAss1 Prof Tan concocting plant-based pro1e,n instant beverages for the Asian palate.\nIt started over a Christmas dinner with an oncologist friend, on how his cancer patients needed to ensure an adequate amount of protein\nintake during treatment and recovery. Available products on the market are L1sually limited to flavours like chocolate, vanilla, strawberry\n- not exactly crowd favourites among the local population.\nThis got Asst Prof Verena Tan, f.cpgramme Leader of SIT's Dietetics and Nutrition degree programme, thinking and tinkering for a plant·\nbased protein supplement with a local twist. What if one could formulate nutritious and tasty plant-based protein supplement?\nBalance Between Nutrition and Taste\nThere were a couple of considerations. First and foremost was to ensure an optimum protein profile when developing a plant-protein\nalternative. From currently available evidence, plant proteins, with the exception of soy, are not considered a high-quality protein source\nas they lack certain essential amino acids required for maintaining or increasing muscle mass.\nInadequate protein intake is also a key contributing factor to the loss of lean muscle. For cancer patients, the loss of lean muscle mass\nmay also be compounded as a result of cancer-related factors such as loss of appetite, psychosocial stress and emotional stress.\nThis loss can lead to poorer tolerance to their cancer treatment. Guidelines for cancer patients typically recommend a protein intake of\nup to 1.Sg per kg of body weight per day, to support protein balance in the body. \"Studies have shown that an elevated protein intake\npromotes the building of lean muscle tissue in cancer patients,\" said Asst Prof Tan.\nCmrently, the commonly used nutritional supplements  for cancer patients on the market are usually sweet, uses whey protein (a\ncomponent of cow's milk) and come in limited flavours. Taste fatigue builds and becomes another barrier to nutrition supplementation\nfor this group of consumers.\nCombining the Best of Many Plants\nEnter Asst Prof Tan's plant-based protein brainwave. She has successfully developed  prototypes made up of a combination of different\nplant-proteins i11 a ratio that provides an optimal essential amino acid profile for muscle health. There is 20g of protein in each serving,\nwhich is shown to be the optimal dose to allow for muscle protein synthesis.\nFurthermore, these instant beverages  have been flavoured for the Asian palate, such as black sesame, coffee, passion fruit, and\nmushroom soup.\nThe verdict? These flavour profiles have been a hit. Preliminary findings have shown positive reception to the prototypes developed.\nLearn more about the protein supplements in the video.\nPlease click bel:l: for a video interview with Asst Prof Verena Tan, Programme Leader of SIT's Dietetics and Nutrition degree programme.\nLaunching Alumni Groups of Passion\nTwo new official SIT Alumni Groups allow SITizens to stay connected even as they keep up their zeal for shared\ninterests\nEl 01 July 2022\nGraduating does not mean you have to leave your interests from your university days behind. June 2022 saw the launch of two official\nAlumni Groups. Specially formed by SIT Alumni to connect with their fellow SITizens, these groups are also supported by the SIT\nAdvancement & Alumni Division.\nSIT Muzeka Alumni Group\nThe SIT Muzeka Alumni Group (SMAG) is the alumni counterpart of Muzeka, SIT's very own student band. Formed in April 2022, the\nSMAG is a platform for alumni to express themselves through music and provide a stress-free space to experience the joy of music\nmaking. The official launch took place on 10 June 2022, with members bonding as they sang and jammed to their favourite songs.\nSMAG welcomes all alumni who have a passion for music -the group has welcomed 50 members to date, at least five of whom were not\nfrom the student band.\nSIT GSA Alumni Group\nAlumni from SIT-GSA (Glasgow School of Art) came together to form the SIT GSA Alumni Group, which held its first networking event on\n23 June 2022.\nSIT-GSA alumni gathered at Projector X: Riverside for some casual networking over food and drinks, also taking the opportunity to catch\nup with old friends and meet with graduates from other years.\nThe event also included a short sharing session by alumni speakers Mr Fariz Junaidi and Ms Christine Lim, who spoke about their work\nexperience since graduating from SIT.
