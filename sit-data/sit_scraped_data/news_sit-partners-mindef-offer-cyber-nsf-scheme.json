    "SIT partners MINDEF to offer Cyber NSF Scheme",
    "(From left to right): BG Mark Tan, Director (Cyber Plans & Policy Directorate), MINDEF; Mr David Koh, Deputy Secretary (Special Projects) and Defence Cyber Chief, MINDEF; Minister Ong Ye Kung; Prof Loh Han Tong, Deputy President (Academic) and Provost, SIT; and Prof Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT at the MOU signing.",
    "Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence Ong Ye Kung officiated at the signing of a work-learn Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF)’s Defence Cyber Organisation (DCO) and the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) on 12 February 2018. The MOU was signed by Defence Cyber Chief Mr David Koh and Professor Loh Han Tong, Deputy President (Academic) and Provost, SIT.",
    "Mr Ong also announced the Cyber NSF Scheme, which all full-time national servicemen (NSFs) in cyber vocations will now come under, and the Cyber Specialist Award, a short-term contract which will be offered to selected cyber NSFs who demonstrate the requisite aptitude and skill, and who meet the stringent selection requirements for the award.",
    "The MOU between DCO and SIT is the first work-learn tie-up between MINDEF and an education institute where NSFs are sent for academic upgrading while employed in an operational role. This will equip them with the necessary skills to better perform their duties, and was made possible through close collaboration between MINDEF, the Cyber Security Agency (CSA)",
    "[1]",
    ", SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and SIT. This work-learn programme will be applicable to NSFs who are recipients of the Cyber Specialist Award. Award recipients will also attend professional courses and attain professional certifications.",
    "Mr Ong said that the new Cyber NSF Scheme and Cyber Specialist Award aim to tap on those in the NSF talent pool who wish to contribute more to national defence in cyber. He said, “MINDEF/SAF has developed a new Cyber NSF scheme that will be able to tap on cyber talents from our NSF pool to bolster the SAF’s cyber defences… We will look at both academic qualifications as well as relevant cyber skills in our selection process. This scheme allows us to tap unto our talented NSFs to meet the operational requirements of our cyber defences, and also allows us to optimise their contribution by giving them the opportunity to apply their cybersecurity skills in the defence of the nation.” He also expressed his hope that the time spent as cyber specialists would help them make the decision to continue honing their cybersecurity skills and contribute to Singapore’s cyber defence as professionals in the national cyber eco-system.",

The MOU was signed by Defence Cyber Chief Mr David Koh and Professor Loh Han Tong, Deputy President (Academic) and Provost, SIT.\nMr Ong also announced the Cyber NSF Scheme, which all full-time national servicemen (NSFs) in cyber vocations will now come under, and the Cyber Specialist Award, a short-term contract which will be offered to selected cyber NSFs who demonstrate the requisite aptitude and skill, and who meet the stringent selection requirements for the award.\nThe MOU between DCO and SIT is the first work-learn tie-up between MINDEF and an education institute where NSFs are sent for academic upgrading while employed in an operational role. This will equip them with the necessary skills to better perform their duties, and was made possible through close collaboration between MINDEF, the Cyber Security Agency (CSA)\n[1]\n, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and SIT. This work-learn programme will be applicable to NSFs who are recipients of the Cyber Specialist Award. Award recipients will also attend professional courses and attain professional certifications.\nMr Ong said that the new Cyber NSF Scheme and Cyber Specialist Award aim to tap on those in the NSF talent pool who wish to contribute more to national defence in cyber. He said, “MINDEF/SAF has developed a new Cyber NSF scheme that will be able to tap on cyber talents from our NSF pool to bolster the SAF’s cyber defences… We will look at both academic qualifications as well as relevant cyber skills in our selection process. This scheme allows us to tap unto our talented NSFs to meet the operational requirements of our cyber defences, and also allows us to optimise their contribution by giving them the opportunity to apply their cybersecurity skills in the defence of the nation.” He also expressed his hope that the time spent as cyber specialists would help them make the decision to continue honing their cybersecurity skills and contribute to Singapore’s cyber defence as professionals in the national cyber eco-system.\nA pilot batch of participants will enlist for full-time NS in the second half of 2018. For future intakes, interested pre-enlistees may apply online at\nwww.mindef.gov.sg/CyberNSF\n.\n[1]\nCSA has been facilitating multi-agency collaboration among MINDEF, government agencies, schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to build an integrated talent pipeline for the Cyber NSF vocation.\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nAcademic Clusters\nInfocomm Technology\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nSIT organises inaugural Applied Learning Conference to bridge academia-industry for future economy\nview\nNext\nTEDxSIT arrives in SIT to spread bold ideas\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
