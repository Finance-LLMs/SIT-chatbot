Eye blinks, jaw tremors or facial\ntwitches.\nWHAT IS STUTTERING?\nEXAMPLES OF STUTTERINGStuttering is a fluency disorder that affects the flow and rate\nof speech. It is a physical disorder and not a language or\npsychological disorder. The child knows what they want to say\nbut just cannot get the words out.\n1\n32, 14\n3\n2Prolongation (dragging) of a sound\n\"taaable\"\n4\nActual cause is still unknown but\nlikely multifactorialSTUTTERING: WHEN DOES IT\nOCCUR?\nCAUSES OF STUTTERINGBegins in first 2 to 3 years of life\nwhen there is rapid growth in\nlanguage development. About\n95% of children who stutter start\nstuttering before 4 years old. ³Incidence: 4 to 5% of\nchildren (3-4 years of age)\nPrevalence: About 1% of\npopulation\nOnset may be gradual or sudden\nGenetics\n(about 60-70% of people\nwho stutter have a family\nmember who stutters)\nProblem with Neural\nProcessing\n(parts of the brain that\ncontrol speech)19\n1723\nOh I see... Are there any other risk\nfactors of stuttering?\nYes. Gender is a risk factor of stuttering. Boys are\n3x more likely to stutter and may be less likely to\noutgrow stuttering than girls.\nYes.  Additionally, family history of stuttering\nincreases the likelihood of stuttering.  5, 25, 29\nW h a t  a r e  r i s k  f a c t o r s ?\nRisk factors are variables associated with the child that\nincreases the chances of the child developing stuttering.\nI read online that boys are more likely\nto stutter, is that true...?\n5, 29\nIt is important to note that\nBilingualism is not a risk factor\nor cause of stuttering!R i s k  f a c t o r s  o f  S t u t t e r i n g\n28\nMy student is stumbling on words e.g.\nWhat- Where is my ball? Is that normal?\nW h a t  i s  D i s f l u e n c y ?\n“Fluency refers to continuity, smoothness, rate, and effort of\nspeech. When we hesitate, use fillers, or repeat ourselves\nduring speech, it is known as disfluency.\"\nP o l y s y l l a b i c  w o r d  r e p e t i t i o n\n\"Gimme gimme the book!\"U n f i n i s h e d  w o r d s\n\"How is the... \"N o r m a l  d i s f l u e n c i e s\n( n o t  s t u t t e r i n g )  1, 3\nN o r m a l  D i s f l u e n c y  v sS t u t t e r i n g\nR e v i s i o n s\n\"What.. where is my ball?\"\nI n t e r j e c t i o n\n\"I want errrr the book.\"\nP h r a s e  r e p e t i t i o n\n\"That is that is that is mine!\"2\nAs preschool children are still developing their language,\nit is normal for children to have disfluencies in speech! In\naddition to these normal disfluencies, children who\nstutter can also produce blocks, repetitions and\nprolongations that tend to occur more frequently and can\nbe associated with greater tension or effort.\nHave poorer language skills\nCan children who stutter\nrecover on their own?\n70-80% of children can recover spontaneously\nbefore 7 years of age.\nHowever, they may be less likely to grow out of it if they:\nWhen is the best time\nto seek help?\nPrompt diagnosis and early intervention\n(before 6 years old) is crucial in yielding the best\noutcome from therapy.\nDelaying treatment may result in long-term\npersistence of stuttering and could impact the child\nnegatively. 10, 18, 25\n21  Are male\nBegin stuttering at a later age\nHave a family member that did not recover from stuttering1\n432\n5   Stutter for more than 6 to 12 months\nMental/\nEmotional\nPrefer to spend time by\nthemselves and possibly avoid\ntalking to other people.\nOlder children who stutter\nhave been found to have\n\"higher scores on the\nAnger/Frustration, Impulsivity,\nand Sadness subscales\".4, 24Affected\ntemperament and\nself regulationImpact on self-\nesteemDue to bullying/teasing faced in\nschool, child may feel anxious, sad\nand reluctant to attend school or\nother social situations.

May affect\npromotion prospects.\nEmployers' perspectives:\n85% agreed stuttering\ndecreases employability;\n40% agreed it would\ninterfere with promotions.\nSome people think jobs with\nminimal social interaction are most\nsuitable for people who stutter.Future\nprospects6, 22Academic\nAchievement\nAffected\nrelationships\nReduced participation in social\nsituations and group work leads to\ndifficulties maintaining social\nrelationships. 11, 20\nSocial\nNegative attitudes towards\nspeech and communication may\nincrease with age and may have\nan impact on self-confidence and\nsocial participation.968\n10Stuttering may affect learning\nexperiences and lead to negative\nimpact on academic performance,\nespecially when assessment is oral.\nThe child may not\nfulfil their full\nacademic/vocational\npotential.\n79\nThey are often the first people to help identify\nchildren who stutter in preschools!\nThey can assist SLTs in collecting speech\nsamples in all languages in the classroom.\nSLTs may approach them to find out more about\nstuttering events in school.T e a c h e r s  a r e  c r u c i a l  b e c a u s e . . .\nThey can refer students who\nstutter to an SLT immediately.\nDuring periods of fluency, give them more opportunities\nto speak.\nIs the boy\ndrawing?\n2 T a l k  s l o w e r\nChildren who stutter are less likely to\nstutter when conversational partners\nspeak slower than them.   13T i p s  fo r  te a c h e r s\n1 A d j u s t  t o  t h e  s p e e c h  f l u e n c y  o f\nC h i l d r e n  w h o  S t u t t e r\nDuring periods of stuttering, reduce the amount of speech.\ne.g. ask close ended questions, multiple choice questions,\nor break questions into smaller parts 15\nWhat did he draw?What colour was the\nflower?\nDid he draw a\nflower or a book?\nT i p s  f o r  t e a c h e r s\nLet children who stutter have more time to say\nwhat they want to say.\n→ Avoid helping children who stutter finish their\nstuttered words.\n→ Instead, praise their effort in speaking.3 U s e  m o r e  w a i t  t i m e26\n20\n4 C h o r a l  r e a d i n g\nLet children who stutter read aloud in unison with\nclassmates.\n→ Reading together with someone helps to reduce\nstuttering and helps the child to build confidence in a\nsupported environment.8Avoid interrupting them - even with\nencouraging words like \"take your time\".\nT i p s  f o r  t e a c h e r s\nMake children who stutter feel that they are being\nheard by maintaining eye contact\nIt may cause the child to stutter more\nChild may associate speaking with negative\nexperiences\nEnsure equal opportunities for speaking between\nchildren who stutter and other preschoolersMaintain interest and engagement with children who\nstutter\nAvoid scolding the child when they stutter\nWhy?\nInstead, remain patient and encourage them to\nparticipate!\nTalk to your students about stuttering  and how we can\nall be supportive\n135B e  a n  e m o t i o n a l  s u p p o r t  f o r\nc h i l d r e n  w h o  s t u t t e r\n6 N e v e r  i m i t a t e  s t u t t e r i n g\nPublic Hospitals\nVisit a General Practitioner or a\nPolyclinic to get a referral letter\nto access SLT services in public\nhospitals.\nPrivate Hospitals/Clinics\nContact them directly for an\nappointment.
