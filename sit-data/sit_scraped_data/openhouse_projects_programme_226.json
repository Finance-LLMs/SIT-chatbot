    "Meet the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit’s New Heroes: Software Engineers",
    "Our Information and Communications Technology (Software Engineering) students have helped bridge healthcare and ICT to create a meaningful impact on lives. Building a mobile application that allows National University Hospital (NUH) doctors to keep track of infants' data on-the-go, our students have taken a step further by improving workflow areas such as minimising human error, offline capabilities, and portability.",

    "The Smart Pill Box",
    "Today, more people are taking care of their health and immune system than ever before. Some senior citizens with multiple prescriptions a day might forget or miss the timing to consume their medication. With the 'Smart Pill Box', our students leverage the power of technology and develop a potential solution for this issue.",

    "Interior Design: JSON models and JavaScript interface",
    "The AI Powered Image Classification and Object Detection for Interior Design project is a system built by our students that consist of a machine learning model which classifies images according to a predefined set of interior design themes. Additionally, the system can detect common objects such as furniture items found in the images. This project, completed for and funded by our industry partner, Sixides, was the first under SIT's newly formed Design Factory @ SIT and featured a cross-cluster collaboration between ICT and DSB clusters.",
