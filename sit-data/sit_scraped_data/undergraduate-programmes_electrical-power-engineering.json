    "The Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Electrical Power Engineering (EPE) is a three-year direct honours degree programme jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University (NU).",
    "As the first locally-offered, dedicated electrical power engineering undergraduate programme, the curriculum is specially customised to meet industry demand in Singapore. It will play an important role in increasing the number of graduates to address the workforce demand in the power sector whilst fulfilling the country’s vision of becoming a Smart Nation. As a joint programme, it will leverage the expertise and resources of both SIT and NU.",
    "Graduates from the SIT-NU EPE programme are needed in diverse sectors including electrical power generation, transmission and distribution, renewable energy systems, smart grids, electrical installations in buildings, transportation electrification, industry automation and applications. Through a rigorous curriculum with a strong industry focus, graduates will be theoretically-grounded and practice-oriented. This will equip them with the necessary technical competence, tools and personal skills that will enable them to continue to develop their understanding, expertise and professionalism as they progress through their career. Having a solid foundation will also facilitate lifelong learning as they embark on their engineering career.",
    "Graduates of Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Electrical Power Engineering may pursue the SIT-awarded Master of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, after at least one year of relevant working experience.",
    "Programme Educational Objectives (PEO) of MSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering",

    "Integrated Work Study Programme",
    "Students of the joint programme will undergo eight months of Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) at a company relevant to their area of study. The IWSP is an integral part of applied learning as it provides an opportunity for students to integrate what they have learnt in the classroom to what is practised in the real world, and vice-versa. The extended period of IWSP, with students performing real work, also provides an opportunity for companies to evaluate the suitability of students as potential employees.",
    "Besides producing practice-oriented graduates, IWSP will also be the platform through which students will be challenged during their work attachment stint to initiate innovative projects under the guidance of SIT’s IWSP academic supervisors and company-appointed work supervisors. Through such projects, students will be given the opportunity to develop engineering solutions for the projects they have identified. In this way, the IWSP will be a key platform that contributes to the inculcation of the SITizen-DNA in every student.",
    "Overseas Immersion Programme",
    "All students will have to complete a three-week attachment at the home campus of Newcastle University where they get to experience life as a student, living and studying in Newcastle, United Kingdom. The programme will include academic lectures, industry visits, library and career talks, research and literature review workshops to prepare students for their final year dissertation projects, as well as visits to local companies, museums and key cultural sites.",
