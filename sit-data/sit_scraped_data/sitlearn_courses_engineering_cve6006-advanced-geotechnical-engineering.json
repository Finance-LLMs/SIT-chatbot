    "Dr. Sigl graduated as Diploma Engineer (MSc) in 1985 from the Technical University of Graz (Austria), in geotechnics and soil mechanics and in 1991 he achieved the PhD in mining engineering at the Mining University of Leoben (Austria). Oskar’s 30 years of experience cover a wide range of projects such as subways, railways, roads, power transmission cables, sewerage mains, underground storage schemes and caverns. Oskar has been working in Singapore since 1997, where he was involved in the detailed design of almost all major underground infra structure projects. This includes the MRT lines, high voltage transmission cable tunnels, underground expressways and deep sewer tunnels. Outside of Singapore, Dr. Sigl was involved in leading roles in the design of underground transportation systems in Dubai, Perth, Brisbane, Sydney, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur as well as the design of underground oil and fuel storage cavern schemes in Saudi Arabia, India and the UAE.",
