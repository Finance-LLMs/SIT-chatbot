    "The fifth edition of The Mapletree Challenge Grand Final, supported by Mapletree Investments (“Mapletree” or “the Group”) and organised by the Singapore Institute of Technology (“SIT”), culminated in a successful Grand Final on 3 May 2024.",
    "Team Aqua Gold, a group of Year 4 SIT students from the Food Technology degree programme, emerged victorious among the five finalist teams, walking away with the grand cash prize of S$8,000.",
    "Team Aqua Gold aims to leverage Singapore's limited farming space by collaborating with local aquafarms to craft Furikake sustainably. Their innovative offering, O.NILO Fish Furikake, is a nutritious topping crafted from tilapia fish fingerlings and okara (soybean pulp). By incorporating tilapia fish bones into the recipe, Team Aqua Gold minimises waste derived from traditional Furikake production. Available in three flavours, the product utilises locally sourced and upcycled ingredients, coupled with sustainable production methods, to reduce both carbon footprint and food waste.",
    "First launched in October 2018, The Mapletree Challenge has nurtured sustainability guardians who are passionate about preserving a sustainable world with innovative solutions. More than 1,600 SIT students from various fields of study have benefitted from the annual challenges and mentorship centred on ‘Sustainability and Innovation’.",
    "This year’s Challenge, held from February to May 2024, saw participants attending masterclasses on entrepreneurship, investor engagement and sales pitching; participating in a forum discussion on entrepreneurship and innovation by leading entrepreneurs; and sharpening their business proposals with advice from industry mentors. More information about The Mapletree Challenge 2024 is detailed in",

    "With 1% of Singapore’s land set aside for farming, Team Aqua Gold sees an opportunity to work with existing local aquafarms to produce Furikake in a sustainable way. Furikake is a Japanese condiment sprinkled on rice, fish, and vegetables. Typically, blends of furikake include ingredients like dried nori (seaweed), toasted sesame seeds, dried fish, dried eggs, dried herbs, salt, and sugar.",
    "Team Aqua Gold’s O.NILO Fish Furikake is a nutritious, ready-to-eat food topping made from tilapia fish fingerlings and okara (soybean pulp). Fish bones of tilapia form part of the ingredients in an effort to minimise wastage. The product comes in three flavours, and the use of locally sourced, upcycled ingredients and sustainable production processes help reduce carbon footprint and food wastage.",

    "Styrofoam packaging has a huge environmental impact. From polluting oceans, contributing to global climate change, and causing danger to human health, the consequences are far-reaching. Nigel’s Fantastic Four offers an alternative, environment-friendly packing solution to the non-biodegradable styrofoam.The team proposes packaging made from mycelium, the mass of branched fibres that make up fungus. Mycelium is a safe, strong, and biodegradable material, and mycelium-based products naturally degrade after their intended product cycle.",
    "The packaging has a natural fibrous texture, which can be used to package electronics and fragile items such as wine bottles.Sustainable packaging is becoming an increasingly high priority for both consumers and brands. The low-energy consumption of growing mushroom fungus to cultivate mycelium, the ability to be custom-moulded, and the compostable quality of this packaging would help organisations meet their sustainability goals and promote a greener earth.",

    "3D printing is achieved through additive manufacturing — the process by which material is joined under computer control to create a three-dimensional object. The material, ranging from liquid resin to powdered grains, is fused together layer by layer. A variety of shapes, including very complex ones, are easily printed from a digital 3D model or CAD file.",
    "‘Conveyo’, a novel 3D Printer designed by Team ETEN Engineering, seeks to elevate this eco-friendly manufacturing process by streamlining production and offering an energy-efficient alternative to conventional 3D printers.",
    "The inclusion of a conveyor system in their 3D printer helps automate the removal of finished parts, which saves time and doesn’t require human intervention. This allows for continuous printing, maximising printing uptime and increasing production. As human intervention is not needed, it results in savings in manpower costs.",
    "Designed for the educational sector and commercial markets in the ASEAN region, Conveyo strives to advance sustainability in the 3D printing industry by reducing the carbon footprint of additive manufacturing and fostering sustainable practices.",

Their innovative offering, O.NILO Fish Furikake, is a nutritious topping crafted from tilapia fish fingerlings and okara (soybean pulp). By incorporating tilapia fish bones into the recipe, Team Aqua Gold minimises waste derived from traditional Furikake production. Available in three flavours, the product utilises locally sourced and upcycled ingredients, coupled with sustainable production methods, to reduce both carbon footprint and food waste.\nFirst launched in October 2018, The Mapletree Challenge has nurtured sustainability guardians who are passionate about preserving a sustainable world with innovative solutions. More than 1,600 SIT students from various fields of study have benefitted from the annual challenges and mentorship centred on ‘Sustainability and Innovation’.\nThis year’s Challenge, held from February to May 2024, saw participants attending masterclasses on entrepreneurship, investor engagement and sales pitching; participating in a forum discussion on entrepreneurship and innovation by leading entrepreneurs; and sharpening their business proposals with advice from industry mentors. More information about The Mapletree Challenge 2024 is detailed in\nAnnex A\n.\n11 teams competed in the semi-finals stage, with five teams progressing to the Grand Final to vie for the Mapletree Gold, Mapletree Silver and Mapletree Bronze awards. The top three teams from the Grand Final were presented cash prizes of S$8,000, S$5,000 and S$3,000.\nThe Mapletree Gold winner, Team Aqua Gold,\nat The Mapletree Challenge 2024 Grand Final held at Mapletree Business City.

(SIT Photo: Keng Photography/Tan Eng Keng)\nMr Bernard Nee, Deputy President (Industry & Community), SIT,\nsaid, “The Mapletree Challenge was a unique initiative that availed learning opportunities through industry and community sustainability challenges. The Challenge has trained hundreds of students to think creatively and offer innovative solutions for sustainable practices, products and services.”\n\"Our continued support for The Mapletree Challenge 2024 aligns with our Corporate Social Responsibility pillar of education. We are committed to nurturing the next generation of innovators who will positively impact our society. We hope the Challenge serves as a stepping stone for students to continue developing entrepreneurial ideas to make a difference,\" said\nMr Edmund Cheng, Chairman, Mapletree.\nThe finalist teams explored various sustainability aspects in products and services – from a smart vending machine that dispenses reusable food containers, a substitute material for styrofoam packaging that is environmentally friendly, a condiment that is produced locally using upcycled ingredients, a mobile app to trade underutilised everyday items which would otherwise be discarded, to a novel 3D printer that automates processes for sustainable operations. The full list of finalists is in\nAnnex B\n.\nAnnex A\nThe Mapletree Challenge 2024\nin its entirety, comprises the following components:\nMasterclass sessions\n(February-March 2024): SIT students took part in masterclass sessions on\nentrepreneurship, attracting investors and sales pitching\nwhich were held on 28 February and 6 March and conducted by industry experts.\nThe Mapletree Innovation and Entrepreneurship Forum\n(13 March 2024): over 60 SIT students attended the panel discussion on entrepreneurship and innovation held at Mapletree Business City.

Aqua Gold [Mapletree Gold Award]\nAs part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Singapore is working towards the ’30 by 30’ goal - to build our agri-food industry’s capability and capacity to sustainably produce 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030.\nWith 1% of Singapore’s land set aside for farming, Team Aqua Gold sees an opportunity to work with existing local aquafarms to produce Furikake in a sustainable way. Furikake is a Japanese condiment sprinkled on rice, fish, and vegetables. Typically, blends of furikake include ingredients like dried nori (seaweed), toasted sesame seeds, dried fish, dried eggs, dried herbs, salt, and sugar.\nTeam Aqua Gold’s O.NILO Fish Furikake is a nutritious, ready-to-eat food topping made from tilapia fish fingerlings and okara (soybean pulp). Fish bones of tilapia form part of the ingredients in an effort to minimise wastage. The product comes in three flavours, and the use of locally sourced, upcycled ingredients and sustainable production processes help reduce carbon footprint and food wastage.\nTeam Members / Degree Programme:\nTsai Kok Pow – Team Lead, Chevonne Luo Zheng Yee,\nAudrey Lim Jia Wen,\nEvelyn Ng Pei Ying,\nNurice Lam Yun Jia,\nAll the above Year 4 students are from the Food Technology degree programme.\n2. Nigel’s Fantastic Four [Mapletree Silver Award]\nStyrofoam packaging has a huge environmental impact. From polluting oceans, contributing to global climate change, and causing danger to human health, the consequences are far-reaching. Nigel’s Fantastic Four offers an alternative, environment-friendly packing solution to the non-biodegradable styrofoam.The team proposes packaging made from mycelium, the mass of branched fibres that make up fungus. Mycelium is a safe, strong, and biodegradable material, and mycelium-based products naturally degrade after their intended product cycle.\nThe packaging has a natural fibrous texture, which can be used to package electronics and fragile items such as wine bottles.Sustainable packaging is becoming an increasingly high priority for both consumers and brands. The low-energy consumption of growing mushroom fungus to cultivate mycelium, the ability to be custom-moulded, and the compostable quality of this packaging would help organisations meet their sustainability goals and promote a greener earth.\nTeam Members / Degree Programme:\nNigel Ang (Team Lead), Year 4; Nicole Tan Hsing Yi, Year 3; Tan Yee Lin, Year 3; Daphne Ng Jing Ni, Year 3; Lim Zhi Xin, Year 3\nAll the above students are from the Food Technology degree programme.\n3. ETEN Engineering [Mapletree Bronze Award]\n3D printing is achieved through additive manufacturing — the process by which material is joined under computer control to create a three-dimensional object. The material, ranging from liquid resin to powdered grains, is fused together layer by layer. A variety of shapes, including very complex ones, are easily printed from a digital 3D model or CAD file.\n‘Conveyo’, a novel 3D Printer designed by Team ETEN Engineering, seeks to elevate this eco-friendly manufacturing process by streamlining production and offering an energy-efficient alternative to conventional 3D printers.\nThe inclusion of a conveyor system in their 3D printer helps automate the removal of finished parts, which saves time and doesn’t require human intervention. This allows for continuous printing, maximising printing uptime and increasing production. As human intervention is not needed, it results in savings in manpower costs.\nDesigned for the educational sector and commercial markets in the ASEAN region, Conveyo strives to advance sustainability in the 3D printing industry by reducing the carbon footprint of additive manufacturing and fostering sustainable practices.\nTeam Members / Degree Programme:\nEthan Lim Wei Qi (Team Lead),\nJeremiah Ho Zhan Rui,\nGareth Tan Jun Long,\nKe Ee Chong\nAll the above Year 1 students are from the Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering degree programme.\n4. Dabaoware [Commendation Prize]\nSingle-use plastic containers in Singapore's hawker centres are a significant source of pollution, leading to unnecessary environmental damage. Introducing Dabaoware, an innovative solution designed to revamp the \"bring-your-own\" initiative by dispensing reusable food containers through smart vending machines. Each container features a robust stainless-steel base for outstanding structural integrity and a flexible, durable cover.\nThe cutting-edge vending machines leverage advanced machine learning and computer vision technology to automate processes. Users simply head to a vending machine to retrieve a takeaway container before buying their food, and return the unwashed container to the vending machine after use, where it would be collected and cleaned in an offsite centralised dishwashing system. The clean containers will then be restocked in the vending machines for the cycle to repeat.\nThis vending machine offers convenience and encourages eco-friendly practices by providing a practical solution for reducing single-use packaging. Ideal for busy urban areas, schools, and hawker centres, the machines seamlessly integrate into the daily routines of Singaporeans who lunch out or order takeaway food, to make sustainability effortless.\nTeam Members / Degree Programme:\nSebastian Nuguid Fernandez - Team Lead, Toh Shao Ern,\nAshsyahid Bin Hussin, Liew Xi Jun Adrian\nAll the above Year 1 students are from the Applied Artificial Intelligence degree programme.\n5. Fintech [Commendation Prize]\nCommon Crates is an innovative mobile platform designed to drive sustainability by allowing users to rent, gift or sell\nunderutilised items such as clothes, bicycles and electronics, thereby fostering a culture of reusability and sharing. By giving these items a new lease of life, the platform addresses the challenge of high disposal rates and environmental degradation by encouraging the circulation of goods that would otherwise contribute to waste.\nThrough the app, users have the option to rent out, sell, or give their items away for free to other interested users. With features like proximity-based discovery to match interested buyers and sellers who are nearby for convenient transactions and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification for secure transactions, Common Crates aims to make sharing easy and efficient while ensuring a safe environment for transactions.
