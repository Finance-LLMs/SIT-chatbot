Said Director of Nursing, KWSH, Ms Jessy Chang Yut Keng, “Through the application of Lean tools, my team learnt about redundancies in the bathing process, and came up with more efficient processes and workload balance. By the end of the programme, we cut down the bathing time of patients and also freed up nurses to work on other value-added tasks.”",

    "In a bid to improve the patient experience and find an approach that would complement its ongoing quality improvement initiatives, NHCS decided to introduce Lean Thinking in 2017. The NHCS team has completed five Lean Skills Development Programmes delivered by SIT to date, each focusing on a patient-facing process. Among the issues addressed were long wait times for patients at the Specialist Outpatient Clinics, wait times for Echocardiography appointments, and wait times for patients to get their medication from the pharmacy. These Lean projects resulted in significant reduction in the wait time, better use of resources and improved patient satisfaction. The overall experience of NHCS with Lean Thinking was extremely positive, and two new projects were initiated in 2020.",

    "As business grew, the catering company faced challenges in managing complex processes, including organising its warehouse and managing excessive inventory. Four Seasons Catering embarked on its Lean journey in April 2018 and the results have been astounding. In the warehouse, storage space was cut by more than half, and the time it took to pack one order was reduced by 5 minutes (a 20% gain). In the dry kitchen, the reorganisation translated to a marked reduction in work processing for ordering and restocking.",

A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was inked between KWSH, SIT and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG)\nto\nsupport KWSH in skills and talent development, and through this,\nenhance\nthe\nstandard of care\nin the sector\n.\nThe National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning at SIT (NACE@SIT) – the first workplace learning centre in an Autonomous University – was also officially launched today with the unveiling of ’The Learning Enterprise’ commemorative book. NACE@SIT will deliver workplace learning projects and develop a community of learning organisations that will support enterprises, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), in building their workplace learning systems and capabilities.\nChampioning KWSH as a SkillsFuture Queen Bee in Community Care\nThe SkillsFuture Queen Bee partnership with KWSH aims to reach out to 100 enterprises in the Community Care sector to build up their capabilities over the next three years. KWSH will galvanise other partners to pilot projects in healthcare innovation, process improvement, technology adoption and workplace learning, as well as support the expansion of job roles and the deepening of skills in the sector. For a start, KWSH will share expertise in areas such as AI wound solution, Lean transformation and community care skills training.\nTechnology and Process Innovation Projects:\nUsing an integrated approach of enterprise change management, KWSH will work with Community Care Organisations (CCOs)\nto identify common issues and develop solutions for technology and process improvement. KWSH will also facilitate collaborations between CCOs and value chain partners to increase enterprise productivity and accelerate technology adoption.\nSkills Training Workshops:\nThrough its Community Training Institute (CTI), KWSH will deliver masterclasses to leaders and professionals within the CCOs and their value chain partners, on business environment analysis, strategy development and monitoring of effectiveness. KWSH will also conduct workshops covering topics relevant to CCOs, such as digitalisation, change management, agile thinking and digital transformation, to strengthen their service delivery model.\nSkills Training Plans and Placement Programmes:\nKWSH will work with CCOs to identify skills gaps, and develop training plans and solutions to strengthen their capabilities and uplift care standards. KWSH will also support partners to\ndevelop,\ntrain\nand\nplace\nprogrammes\nfor\nin-demand\njob roles such as Healthcare Assistant\ns\n. This will increase employment opportunities and enhance career progression in the Community Care sector.\nAs part of the MOU, NACE@SIT will also tap on SIT’s network and experience in applied learning and best-in-class practices, to support KWSH in identifying skills gaps in the sector and training for the Community Care sector.\nDr Ow Chee Chung, CEO, KWSH, said, “Through this strategic partnership with SSG and NACE@SIT, we are able to sharpen, as well as deepen, the courses and training available at KWSH CTI. In addition, with this mandate and the resources from our collaboration, we will be able to reach out to more CCOs, thereby enhancing the skills of the sector and improving our standard of care.”\nLaunch of NACE@SIT\nNACE@SIT is an extension of the NACE eco-system to establish more centres to build up workplace learning capabilities of enterprises and SMEs. NACE@SIT will focus on the community care sector as one of its priority sectors\n[1]\n. Over the next five years, the initiative aims to benefit 700 enterprises in three ways:\nLeverage SIT’s SkillsFuture Work-Study programmes\nto provide training and mentorship to participating students and enterprises, as well as build up the workplace learning capability of enterprises.\nDrive workplace solutions\nby implementing workplace learning practices for enterprise transformation. NACE@SIT will partner international workplace learning experts to impart best-in-class training practices and provide certification of trainers.\nShare best practices and success stories\nof workplace learning journeys through fostering a community of learning organisations.\nThe Centre will also develop customised solutions to strengthen in-house training systems to support talent attraction, development and retention.\n“\nAs a University of Applied Learning, SIT strives to champion\nworkplace learning as an integral component of the work-learn continuum.\nThrough\nNACE@SIT, the first workplace learning centre in an Autonomous University, we hope to help organisations like KWSH build workplace competencies and facilitate employees’ learning at their work environment. SIT will continue to expand our suite of integrated industry solutions to build a strong skills ecosystem and workplace learning culture in organisations,” said Professor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT.\n“The strategic partnerships with KWSH as a SkillsFuture Queen Bee and with NACE@SIT are part of the next bound of SkillsFuture. We aim to drive up employer participation in skills and workforce development. We also aim to strengthen workplace training capabilities, which is an important enabler. We envisage that these partnerships that we have signed today will help to transform the Community Care sector and deepen skills in the workforce,” said Mr Ong Tze Chin, Chief Executive, SSG.\nLaunch of Commemorative Book – ‘The Learning Enterprise’\nCommemorating the launch of NACE@SIT was the unveiling of a book, ‘The Learning Enterprise’, which documents the learning journey of SIT with the first four local companies pioneering in workplace learning and Lean transformation. The book illustrates how the four companies – National Heart Centre Singapore, Four Seasons Catering, Shalom Movers and KWSH – improve their processes and build a culture of continuous learning by introducing Lean Thinking philosophies and engaging employees in co-creating solutions for long-term productivity gains. Please refer to\nAnnex A\nfor more details.\n“This book aims to share best practices and organisational transformational strategies, which we have developed with our partner organisations, with the intent to build new capabilities in innovations and work process improvements,” said Mr Arthur Poh, Director, NACE@SIT. The Centre hopes to publish case studies on the workplace learning journeys of its partner organisations every year, to provide better insights and perspectives on workplace learning. “Leveraging SIT’s expertise, NACE@SIT will foster best-in-class workplace learning andragogy to benefit organisations in Singapore,” he added.\nDonation to establish Sing Lun Scholarship at SIT\nThe event also commemorated a $1 million donation from Mr Patrick Lee Kwok Kie, Chairman of Sing Lun Holdings Pte Ltd, President of Yangzheng Foundation, and Chairman of KWSH’s Board of Directors, in support of the new Sing Lun Scholarship.\nMr Lee’s gift will enable SIT to award two Sing Lun Scholarships in Academic Year 2021/22, and at least six scholarships annually from the following academic years. Valued at $10,000 each, the endowed Sing Lun Scholarship aims to nurture academically outstanding undergraduates at SIT, who have also made significant contributions to SIT or the community beyond their academic studies.\nScholarship recipients are encouraged to volunteer for at least 12 days during the academic year, and to continue to participate in meaningful community projects in the key areas of need.\n“SIT is thankful for the unwavering support from Mr Patrick Lee Kwok Kie, who has set up the endowed Yangzheng Foundation Bursary to help SIT’s financially-disadvantaged undergraduates since 2013. His philanthropic leadership will greatly benefit our students, and support SIT’s projects and community initiatives,” added Professor Tan Thiam Soon.\n[1]\nPriority sectors are community care, energy, transport maintenance, logistics and food innovation.\nAnnex A:\n‘The Learning Enterprise’ –\nThe book features four case studies on how the following organisations build their workplace competencies and facilitate workplace learning:\nKwong Wai Shiu Hospital\n:\nKWSH began her Lean journey with SIT in 2018, and in the space of two years, more than 20 staff have been trained in the necessary Lean skill sets which empower them, as Lean Champions, to spearhead various transformation projects within the organisation. Having been appointed as a Community Training Institute (CTI) in Singapore, KWSH is now tasked with a greater role as Lead Enterprise, to catalyse the Lean and Innovation mindset among the Community Care sector. This case study looks into how the organisation has managed to reduce the workload for its staff.\nA\nteam of nurses from KWSH took part in a six-month Lean skills development programme with SIT, where they successfully improved the management of morning shift tasks, notably the bathing process of patients. Said Director of Nursing, KWSH, Ms Jessy Chang Yut Keng, “Through the application of Lean tools, my team learnt about redundancies in the bathing process, and came up with more efficient processes and workload balance. By the end of the programme, we cut down the bathing time of patients and also freed up nurses to work on other value-added tasks.”\nNational Heart Centre Singapore:\nIn a bid to improve the patient experience and find an approach that would complement its ongoing quality improvement initiatives, NHCS decided to introduce Lean Thinking in 2017. The NHCS team has completed five Lean Skills Development Programmes delivered by SIT to date, each focusing on a patient-facing process. Among the issues addressed were long wait times for patients at the Specialist Outpatient Clinics, wait times for Echocardiography appointments, and wait times for patients to get their medication from the pharmacy. These Lean projects resulted in significant reduction in the wait time, better use of resources and improved patient satisfaction. The overall experience of NHCS with Lean Thinking was extremely positive, and two new projects were initiated in 2020.\nFour Seasons Catering:\nAs business grew, the catering company faced challenges in managing complex processes, including organising its warehouse and managing excessive inventory. Four Seasons Catering embarked on its Lean journey in April 2018 and the results have been astounding. In the warehouse, storage space was cut by more than half, and the time it took to pack one order was reduced by 5 minutes (a 20% gain). In the dry kitchen, the reorganisation translated to a marked reduction in work processing for ordering and restocking.\nShalom Movers:\nSMEs often find themselves struggling with ever-increasing operational costs in a tight labour crunch. These problems are more eminent in the logistics industry, which relies heavily on manpower and less receptive to technological innovations.\nShalom Movers participated in the Lean Skills Development Programme at SIT in October 2017 with the aim to improve operational efficiency and upskill its workforce. Thanks to the adaptiveness of its staff, the company reaped tangible results, such as increased productivity and shorter process time. Redesign in warehouse operations resulted in the deployment of excess staff to higher functions. The greatest change as a result of Lean was the mindset shift in the people and their yearning for continuous improvement.\nAbout Singapore Institute of Technology\nSingapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is Singapore’s University of Applied Learning, offering applied degree programmes targeted at growth sectors of the economy.

It is now one of the most established providers in the ILTC (Intermediate and Long Term Care) sector.\nAt present, KWSH operates a nursing home, a rehabilitation centre, a traditional Chinese medicine centre, three community care centres and offers home care services. Many of its patients are from the lower-income group and their fees are heavily subsidised. KWSH also runs a community training institute catering to the training needs of its staff and the sector.\nTo better serve the rapidly ageing population, KWSH has undergone redevelopment to be transformed into an integrated community healthcare hub, providing healthcare services to its residents and the community. With the completion of the redevelopment in 2018, KWSH is now the largest single-site nursing home with over 600 beds as well as expansion in its other services.\nVisit\nwww.kwsh.org.sg\nfor more information.\nAbout Sing Lun Holdings Pte Ltd\nFounded in 1951, Sing Lun started as a textile trading company but has since successfully diversified into a privately-owned enterprise with a diverse range of business interests worldwide.
