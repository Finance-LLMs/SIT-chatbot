    "Transforming Trash into Treasure: How an SIT Alumnus is Reshaping Sustainability with Semula",
    "To Jeryl Yep, saving the environment is not just a lofty aspiration; it’s about solving real problems by creating economic value. His successful sustainability business, Semula, builds on those principles.",
    "As a child, Jeryl wanted to conserve the earth's natural resources. Little did he know that this dream would evolve into a full-fledged sustainability business. Today,",
    "Semula",
    ", his “green” baby, is on a mission to reduce waste by creating tangible products from Singapore’s discarded plastic – one tonne at a time.",
    "The name \"Semula,\" which means \"again,\" \"redo,\" or \"restart\" in Malay, perfectly captures the essence of the business: a commitment to giving waste a second life, reimagining and repurposing it for a more sustainable future. Through innovative, eco-friendly solutions, Semula provides a new life to discarded material to reduce our collective environmental footprint.",
    "Jeryl’s conviction to do his part for the environment was cemented during his polytechnic years when he picked up scuba diving and fishing, hobbies that deepened his connection to the natural world. While diving off Tioman island, he was heartbroken to see the sea marred by litter and oil. Years later, Jeryl returned to the same diving spot, pleasantly surprised by the pristine waters. After speaking with the locals, he discovered that the community had been incentivised to keep the area clean as it attracted more tourists and boosted their livelihood.",
    "“That’s when it hit me,” he said. “I then realised that to truly protect the environment, there needs to be an economic incentive for the people living within it.”",
    "Journey to Entrepreneurship at SIT",
    "Jeryl (far left) at his graduation ceremony in 2017. (Photo: Jeryl Yep)",
    "After completing his diploma in Chemical and Green Technology, Jeryl decided to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering at SIT. He was driven by a desire to understand the inner workings of systems and processes – knowledge he believed would better equip him to tackle the complex challenge of climate change and contribute meaningfully to environmental preservation.",
    "For Jeryl, the time at SIT was a period of growth, discovery, and inspiration that ultimately laid the foundation for his entrepreneurial journey. Among the many defining moments of Jeryl’s time at SIT, the Overseas Immersion Programme at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany was a highlight. This experience not only broadened his global perspective but also solidified his commitment to pursuing a career in sustainability.",
    "Immersed in Germany’s sustainability-driven lifestyle, Jeryl witnessed the success of the Deposit Return Scheme (Pfandsystem), which encourages recycling by offering a deposit refund for returned beverage containers. This experience exposed him to how effective policies and public engagement foster a culture of sustainability. Inspired by Germany’s waste management approach, Jeryl’s dedication to a career in sustainability was strengthened, driving him to bring similar innovative solutions to Singapore.",
    "He also fondly recalls his involvement in various co-curricular activities (CCAs), particularly his role as an exco member of the SIT Aquathlon team. This experience not only allowed him to connect with nature but also resonated deeply with his long-term vision of adopting sustainable practices. Through the Aquathlon, Jeryl developed a stronger appreciation for the environment and the importance of preserving it, aligning perfectly with his commitment to creating sustainable solutions. This blend of active engagement with nature and leadership in a sustainability-focused CCA further strengthened his dedication to pursuing a career in sustainability. He also participated in an entrepreneurship case competition organised by SIT, and his team won a seed funding of $1,000, which he used to start his sustainability business, Green Transition, that later morphed into what is now known as Semula. These experiences, both inside and outside the classroom, helped shape his character, foster invaluable connections, and fuel his passion for making a tangible impact on the environment.",
    "Running Semula as a Sustainable Business",
    "Jeryl (second from the left) sharing a moment of camaraderie and achievement with his colleagues. (Photo: Jeryl Yep)",
    "Jeryl in action at work, focused and dedicated to his craft. (Photo: Jeryl Yep)",
    "Building a sustainable business is rarely a straight path. Jeryl knows this firsthand, as his journey with Semula has been marked by trial and reinvention.",
    "“Semula has gone through six different iterations since I first conceived the idea in 2020,” he said. His earliest concepts, including a spray-on solar cell, seemed promising but weren’t practical from a business standpoint.",
    "“I quickly learnt that solving an environmental problem is not enough. If a business is to succeed, it must also address an economic challenge,” he explained.",
    "Through persistence, Jeryl and his two partners found their breakthrough. Beyond reducing plastic waste in Singapore, Semula also creates new materials that can be repurposed into functional and practical things. The company has converted more than five tonnes of high-density polyethene plastic waste into items like countertops, furniture, and even art installations. Companies can also work directly with Semula to transform plastic waste into sustainable and usable materials. Leading the way are companies such as Foreword Coffee Roasters and Y21, which have partnered Semula to produce sustainable designs that reduce plastic waste and promot a more sustainable future.",
    "Functional furniture at Foreword Coffee Roasters, crafted by Semula from recycled plastic waste, showcasing sustainability in design. (Photo: Foreward Coffee)",
    "A countertop at Y21, expertly crafted by Semula from recycled plastic waste, blending sustainability with design. (Photo: Y21)",
    "Yet, the sheer volume of plastic waste Semula handles today tells a sobering story. Over the last four years, the amount of plastic waste collected by the company has grown exponentially. While this signals Semula’s success, it also highlights an uncomfortable truth: Singapore’s plastic consumption has not decreased despite ongoing climate change conversations and the nation’s 2030 net-zero sustainability goals.",
    "For Jeryl, this is the real issue at hand. “The solution isn’t to recycle or upcycle more,” he points out. “The real solution is to produce less and consume less.”",
    "Recycling and upcycling, while necessary, only address the symptoms of a deeper problem – one driven by convenience, overconsumption, and an economy still reliant on single-use plastics. Without a fundamental shift in mindset and systemic changes at both consumer and corporate levels, Jeryl believes the cycle of waste will only continue.",
    "Sustainability is Not a Dead End",
    "In driving a circular economy in plastic waste, Semula hopes to scale its efforts even further, transforming repurposed plastics into raw building materials that can be used in construction.",
    "“Building materials are always needed. Filling that need with repurposed materials will help reduce plastic waste and create a more sustainable way of living.”",
    "Semula embodies Jeryl’s vision: revitalising the environment through practical solutions that are not only sustainable but also economically viable.",
    "“Tackling climate change is important. But to be able to do anything significant, we have to shift our perspective and see that you can also make a living from it.”",

His successful sustainability business, Semula, builds on those principles.\nAs a child, Jeryl wanted to conserve the earth's natural resources. Little did he know that this dream would evolve into a full-fledged sustainability business. Today,\nSemula\n, his “green” baby, is on a mission to reduce waste by creating tangible products from Singapore’s discarded plastic – one tonne at a time.\nThe name \"Semula,\" which means \"again,\" \"redo,\" or \"restart\" in Malay, perfectly captures the essence of the business: a commitment to giving waste a second life, reimagining and repurposing it for a more sustainable future. Through innovative, eco-friendly solutions, Semula provides a new life to discarded material to reduce our collective environmental footprint.\nJeryl’s conviction to do his part for the environment was cemented during his polytechnic years when he picked up scuba diving and fishing, hobbies that deepened his connection to the natural world. While diving off Tioman island, he was heartbroken to see the sea marred by litter and oil. Years later, Jeryl returned to the same diving spot, pleasantly surprised by the pristine waters. After speaking with the locals, he discovered that the community had been incentivised to keep the area clean as it attracted more tourists and boosted their livelihood.\n“That’s when it hit me,” he said. “I then realised that to truly protect the environment, there needs to be an economic incentive for the people living within it.”\nJourney to Entrepreneurship at SIT\nJeryl (far left) at his graduation ceremony in 2017. (Photo: Jeryl Yep)\nAfter completing his diploma in Chemical and Green Technology, Jeryl decided to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering at SIT. He was driven by a desire to understand the inner workings of systems and processes – knowledge he believed would better equip him to tackle the complex challenge of climate change and contribute meaningfully to environmental preservation.\nFor Jeryl, the time at SIT was a period of growth, discovery, and inspiration that ultimately laid the foundation for his entrepreneurial journey. Among the many defining moments of Jeryl’s time at SIT, the Overseas Immersion Programme at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany was a highlight. This experience not only broadened his global perspective but also solidified his commitment to pursuing a career in sustainability.\nImmersed in Germany’s sustainability-driven lifestyle, Jeryl witnessed the success of the Deposit Return Scheme (Pfandsystem), which encourages recycling by offering a deposit refund for returned beverage containers. This experience exposed him to how effective policies and public engagement foster a culture of sustainability. Inspired by Germany’s waste management approach, Jeryl’s dedication to a career in sustainability was strengthened, driving him to bring similar innovative solutions to Singapore.\nHe also fondly recalls his involvement in various co-curricular activities (CCAs), particularly his role as an exco member of the SIT Aquathlon team. This experience not only allowed him to connect with nature but also resonated deeply with his long-term vision of adopting sustainable practices. Through the Aquathlon, Jeryl developed a stronger appreciation for the environment and the importance of preserving it, aligning perfectly with his commitment to creating sustainable solutions. This blend of active engagement with nature and leadership in a sustainability-focused CCA further strengthened his dedication to pursuing a career in sustainability. He also participated in an entrepreneurship case competition organised by SIT, and his team won a seed funding of $1,000, which he used to start his sustainability business, Green Transition, that later morphed into what is now known as Semula. These experiences, both inside and outside the classroom, helped shape his character, foster invaluable connections, and fuel his passion for making a tangible impact on the environment.\nRunning Semula as a Sustainable Business\nJeryl (second from the left) sharing a moment of camaraderie and achievement with his colleagues. (Photo: Jeryl Yep)\nJeryl in action at work, focused and dedicated to his craft. (Photo: Jeryl Yep)\nBuilding a sustainable business is rarely a straight path. Jeryl knows this firsthand, as his journey with Semula has been marked by trial and reinvention.\n“Semula has gone through six different iterations since I first conceived the idea in 2020,” he said. His earliest concepts, including a spray-on solar cell, seemed promising but weren’t practical from a business standpoint.\n“I quickly learnt that solving an environmental problem is not enough. If a business is to succeed, it must also address an economic challenge,” he explained.\nThrough persistence, Jeryl and his two partners found their breakthrough. Beyond reducing plastic waste in Singapore, Semula also creates new materials that can be repurposed into functional and practical things. The company has converted more than five tonnes of high-density polyethene plastic waste into items like countertops, furniture, and even art installations. Companies can also work directly with Semula to transform plastic waste into sustainable and usable materials. Leading the way are companies such as Foreword Coffee Roasters and Y21, which have partnered Semula to produce sustainable designs that reduce plastic waste and promot a more sustainable future.\nFunctional furniture at Foreword Coffee Roasters, crafted by Semula from recycled plastic waste, showcasing sustainability in design. (Photo: Foreward Coffee)\nA countertop at Y21, expertly crafted by Semula from recycled plastic waste, blending sustainability with design. (Photo: Y21)\nYet, the sheer volume of plastic waste Semula handles today tells a sobering story. Over the last four years, the amount of plastic waste collected by the company has grown exponentially. While this signals Semula’s success, it also highlights an uncomfortable truth: Singapore’s plastic consumption has not decreased despite ongoing climate change conversations and the nation’s 2030 net-zero sustainability goals.\nFor Jeryl, this is the real issue at hand. “The solution isn’t to recycle or upcycle more,” he points out. “The real solution is to produce less and consume less.”\nRecycling and upcycling, while necessary, only address the symptoms of a deeper problem – one driven by convenience, overconsumption, and an economy still reliant on single-use plastics. Without a fundamental shift in mindset and systemic changes at both consumer and corporate levels, Jeryl believes the cycle of waste will only continue.\nSustainability is Not a Dead End\nIn driving a circular economy in plastic waste, Semula hopes to scale its efforts even further, transforming repurposed plastics into raw building materials that can be used in construction.\n“Building materials are always needed. Filling that need with repurposed materials will help reduce plastic waste and create a more sustainable way of living.”\nSemula embodies Jeryl’s vision: revitalising the environment through practical solutions that are not only sustainable but also economically viable.\n“Tackling climate change is important. But to be able to do anything significant, we have to shift our perspective and see that you can also make a living from it.”\nTopics\nAlumni\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nBridging the Gap Between Theory and Industry\nview\nNext\nA First-of-Its-Kind Toolkit For The Visually Impaired To Navigate The Digital World\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences"
