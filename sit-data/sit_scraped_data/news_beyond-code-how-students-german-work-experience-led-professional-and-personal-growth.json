    "Beyond the Code: How a Student’s German Work Experience Led to Professional and Personal Growth",
    "Software Engineering student Mandy Neo was able to jump right into her task of developing an app that enhances tire health monitoring for Continental during her Overseas Integrated Work Study Programme (OIWSP). Yet it was the cultural immersion - managing cross-cultural differences and navigating life in Germany - that truly pushed her to jump out of her comfort zone and broaden her horizons both professionally and personally.",
    "Mandy embracing new cultural experiences and sights as she explores Germany during her OIWSP internship with Continental. (Photo: Mandy Neo)",
    "From March to August 2024, Mandy Neo, a final-year student of SIT’s Information and Communications Technology (Software Engineering) degree programme, interned at Continental, a global leader in automotive technology and tire manufacturing, where she contributed to the development of a",
    "mobile app",
    "aimed at enhancing the company’s services and customer experience. During her internship, she was based at Continental’s Regensburg office, one of its many locations in Germany.",
    "This was part of",
    "SIT’s Overseas Integrated Work Study Programme (OIWSP)",
    "– a distinctive applied learning feature for students to acquire global insights while gaining industry experience.",
    "Embracing A New Overseas Work Environment",
    "For Mandy, it was a smooth transition workwise as she found that her studies at SIT had prepared her well for her assigned tasks of developing new app features to monitor the tire health of clients’ vehicle fleets.",
    "From testing to debugging code to employing agile methodology throughout the app development process, Mandy felt thankful that the software principles that she had learnt in SIT prepared her to jump straight into work.",
    "“We had a module which trained us to follow Scrum closely, as well as to use JIRA software to track our tasks. This was extremely helpful as at Continental, we also used the same software tools to track our project journey. So, what we were learning in class is similar to what is happening in the real world. OIWSP gave me an opportunity to test those theories learnt in university against real industry applications.”",
    "Mandy working in the Continental office on the mobile app she developed, designed to optimise tire health monitoring for fleet management. (Photo: Mandy Neo)",
    "Beyond the technical tasks, however, was where Mandy was able to really benefit from the overseas experience.",
    "“One of the key things I learnt was how to adapt to a new work environment, where there are different cultural styles and professional expectations. Besides colleagues from Germany, we also had to work with colleagues from other parts of Europe such as Portugal and Romania. One thing I discovered was that for many of them, they tend to draw a clearer distinction between work and break time. They are highly focused and efficient during work hours but adopt a much more relaxed approach outside of work. In contrast, I feel that in Singapore, we may not always draw the lines as clearly.”",
    "The other learning point that Mandy took away from her OIWSP experience was approaching tasks from different perspectives and being more proactive in problem-solving.",
    "“It’s not like in university, where we had to start a project from scratch, and know everything that is going on. Here we are jumping onto an existing project, with a large existing base with pages of documentation. So, sometimes you will need to trace back and look at legacy files to understand the project. However, this is common, as documentation can sometimes be incomplete,” Mandy explained.",
    "“What I found helpful in overcoming my challenges was having more open communication with my mentors and supervisors,” said Mandy. “I learnt to adjust my approach by breaking down new tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, especially when working with unfamiliar files. Instead of assuming I understood everything from the start, I started asking specific questions early on to clear up uncertainties. This helped me save time, gain a better understanding, and stay on track with my progress.”",
    "More Than Just Professional Growth",
    "Beyond the workplace, Mandy feels that living in Germany also enabled her to broaden her horizons. “It pushed me out of my comfort zone, because on top of working, I also had to manage other aspects relating to daily life as well. I had to be independent and adaptable to new environments, while also dealing with language barriers in a foreign country.”",
    "For example, Mandy had to navigate the local transportation system, which was different from what she was used to back home and familiarise herself with the city by learning the streets and locating essential services. Managing her finances in a foreign currency and learning how to budget efficiently were new challenges for her as well. The local routine was different, with most places closing earlier in the evenings and on Sundays, so she had to plan ahead and be more organised with her time. Another significant change was the need to pack her lunch every day, as it is common in Germany to bring lunch to work rather than eating out, which can be expensive.",
    "Although life in Regensburg was busy, it was incredibly fulfilling. Mandy felt more connected to nature, as she was frequently invited on hikes and trips to nearby cities. These outings provided a great way to unwind and appreciate the beauty of the surroundings, helping her maintain a balance between work and leisure.",
    "Mandy is thankful for the support provided by both her mentor at Continental, as well as students and staff from Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule (OTH), which is the university partner for her OIWSP.",
    "On top of assisting with practical issues such as housing, visas and insurance, OTH also assigned some of their students to help with orientating Mandy and her two fellow SIT interns around the city, as well as checking in periodically to see how they were doing.",
    "“Throughout the semester, we had a group chat, where our seniors from OTH would share interesting details about the city, as well as invite us to nights out, picnics and hikes around some of the local spots.",
    "I also had the opportunity to immerse myself in local traditions, festivals and cuisines, which added a unique and enriching dimension to my experience. I’m really grateful for the international friendships that I had formed there,” Mandy added.",
    "One of the highlights of her experience was attending a local festival with some of her German friends. It was truly memorable, especially seeing everyone in their traditional outfits. One of the most memorable parts of the festival was the large tents, where locals gathered to enjoy food and beer while listening to live traditional music. The atmosphere was incredible, with people standing on chairs, dancing on tables, and singing along. It was a fun and lively celebration that gave her a true sense of the local spirit.",
    "Mandy discovering the rich history and culture of Germany through exploring iconic landmarks during her OIWSP experience. (Photo: Mandy Neo)",
    "Ready to Thrive in the Workforce",
    "In January 2025, Mandy officially completed her course of studies at SIT and is currently looking for work.",
    "Even as she prepares to enter the workforce, she feels an added sense of confidence, knowing that OIWSP has provided an added boost to her professional growth and personal development.",
    "Hence, to all SIT students who might be considering whether to apply for OIWSP, her advice is to just “go for it”.",
    "“You’ll gain not just hands-on industry knowledge but also develop soft skills, all while experiencing life in a different setting and culture. Although it can be challenging at times, it’s also rewarding as it gives you a new perspective that you cannot get from a classroom.”",

Yet it was the cultural immersion - managing cross-cultural differences and navigating life in Germany - that truly pushed her to jump out of her comfort zone and broaden her horizons both professionally and personally.\nMandy embracing new cultural experiences and sights as she explores Germany during her OIWSP internship with Continental. (Photo: Mandy Neo)\nFrom March to August 2024, Mandy Neo, a final-year student of SIT’s Information and Communications Technology (Software Engineering) degree programme, interned at Continental, a global leader in automotive technology and tire manufacturing, where she contributed to the development of a\nmobile app\naimed at enhancing the company’s services and customer experience. During her internship, she was based at Continental’s Regensburg office, one of its many locations in Germany.\nThis was part of\nSIT’s Overseas Integrated Work Study Programme (OIWSP)\n– a distinctive applied learning feature for students to acquire global insights while gaining industry experience.\nEmbracing A New Overseas Work Environment\nFor Mandy, it was a smooth transition workwise as she found that her studies at SIT had prepared her well for her assigned tasks of developing new app features to monitor the tire health of clients’ vehicle fleets.\nFrom testing to debugging code to employing agile methodology throughout the app development process, Mandy felt thankful that the software principles that she had learnt in SIT prepared her to jump straight into work.\n“We had a module which trained us to follow Scrum closely, as well as to use JIRA software to track our tasks. This was extremely helpful as at Continental, we also used the same software tools to track our project journey. So, what we were learning in class is similar to what is happening in the real world. OIWSP gave me an opportunity to test those theories learnt in university against real industry applications.”\nMandy working in the Continental office on the mobile app she developed, designed to optimise tire health monitoring for fleet management. (Photo: Mandy Neo)\nBeyond the technical tasks, however, was where Mandy was able to really benefit from the overseas experience.\n“One of the key things I learnt was how to adapt to a new work environment, where there are different cultural styles and professional expectations. Besides colleagues from Germany, we also had to work with colleagues from other parts of Europe such as Portugal and Romania. One thing I discovered was that for many of them, they tend to draw a clearer distinction between work and break time. They are highly focused and efficient during work hours but adopt a much more relaxed approach outside of work. In contrast, I feel that in Singapore, we may not always draw the lines as clearly.”\nThe other learning point that Mandy took away from her OIWSP experience was approaching tasks from different perspectives and being more proactive in problem-solving.\n“It’s not like in university, where we had to start a project from scratch, and know everything that is going on. Here we are jumping onto an existing project, with a large existing base with pages of documentation. So, sometimes you will need to trace back and look at legacy files to understand the project. However, this is common, as documentation can sometimes be incomplete,” Mandy explained.\n“What I found helpful in overcoming my challenges was having more open communication with my mentors and supervisors,” said Mandy. “I learnt to adjust my approach by breaking down new tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, especially when working with unfamiliar files. Instead of assuming I understood everything from the start, I started asking specific questions early on to clear up uncertainties. This helped me save time, gain a better understanding, and stay on track with my progress.”\nMore Than Just Professional Growth\nBeyond the workplace, Mandy feels that living in Germany also enabled her to broaden her horizons. “It pushed me out of my comfort zone, because on top of working, I also had to manage other aspects relating to daily life as well. I had to be independent and adaptable to new environments, while also dealing with language barriers in a foreign country.”\nFor example, Mandy had to navigate the local transportation system, which was different from what she was used to back home and familiarise herself with the city by learning the streets and locating essential services. Managing her finances in a foreign currency and learning how to budget efficiently were new challenges for her as well. The local routine was different, with most places closing earlier in the evenings and on Sundays, so she had to plan ahead and be more organised with her time. Another significant change was the need to pack her lunch every day, as it is common in Germany to bring lunch to work rather than eating out, which can be expensive.\nAlthough life in Regensburg was busy, it was incredibly fulfilling. Mandy felt more connected to nature, as she was frequently invited on hikes and trips to nearby cities. These outings provided a great way to unwind and appreciate the beauty of the surroundings, helping her maintain a balance between work and leisure.\nMandy is thankful for the support provided by both her mentor at Continental, as well as students and staff from Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule (OTH), which is the university partner for her OIWSP.\nOn top of assisting with practical issues such as housing, visas and insurance, OTH also assigned some of their students to help with orientating Mandy and her two fellow SIT interns around the city, as well as checking in periodically to see how they were doing.\n“Throughout the semester, we had a group chat, where our seniors from OTH would share interesting details about the city, as well as invite us to nights out, picnics and hikes around some of the local spots.\nI also had the opportunity to immerse myself in local traditions, festivals and cuisines, which added a unique and enriching dimension to my experience. I’m really grateful for the international friendships that I had formed there,” Mandy added.\nOne of the highlights of her experience was attending a local festival with some of her German friends. It was truly memorable, especially seeing everyone in their traditional outfits. One of the most memorable parts of the festival was the large tents, where locals gathered to enjoy food and beer while listening to live traditional music. The atmosphere was incredible, with people standing on chairs, dancing on tables, and singing along. It was a fun and lively celebration that gave her a true sense of the local spirit.\nMandy discovering the rich history and culture of Germany through exploring iconic landmarks during her OIWSP experience. (Photo: Mandy Neo)\nReady to Thrive in the Workforce\nIn January 2025, Mandy officially completed her course of studies at SIT and is currently looking for work.\nEven as she prepares to enter the workforce, she feels an added sense of confidence, knowing that OIWSP has provided an added boost to her professional growth and personal development.\nHence, to all SIT students who might be considering whether to apply for OIWSP, her advice is to just “go for it”.\n“You’ll gain not just hands-on industry knowledge but also develop soft skills, all while experiencing life in a different setting and culture. Although it can be challenging at times, it’s also rewarding as it gives you a new perspective that you cannot get from a classroom.”\nIf you are interested in applying for OIWSP, or wish to find out more about what the programme entails, visit:\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/life-at-sit/global-experience/global-mobility-programmes\n.\nTopics\nSITizen\nOverseas Immersion Programme\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nInfocomm Technology\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nHow NAMIC Hub@SIT Fused Art with Additive Manufacturing to Create a Thought-provoking Sustainability Exhibition\nview\nNext\nEngineering the Future: Giving Students a Head Start in the Corporate World\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences"
