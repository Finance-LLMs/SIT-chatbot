Rag and Flag – an annual\nevent where students perform to\nraise money for charity – will take\non an in-person format this year.\nNanyang Technological Univer-\nsity (NTU) will have some virtual\norientation  activities  to  allow\nthose unable to physically attend\nto participate.\nThe Singapore Management Uni-\nversity (SMU), Singapore Univer-\nsity of Social Sciences and Singa-\npore Institute of Technology (SIT)\nwill have physical orientation activ-\nities next month and in August,\nwith SIT hosting exclusively in-per-\nson events.\nThe  Singapore  University  of\nTechnology and Design, which had\nin-person orientation activities in\nsmall group settings over the past\ntwo years, will have its orientation\nin September.\nBefore the pandemic, thousands\nof  freshmen  entering  university\nwould often participate in residen-\ntial camps.\nHowever, orientation camps in\n2020 and last year were largely vir-\ntual and muted affairs, owing to\nCovid-19  restrictions  on  group\nsizes and gatherings.\nThe return of in-person activi-\nties has been welcomed by stu-\ndents.\nThird-year student Ryanne Han,\n20, who is in charge of games and\nlogistics  for  NUS  Life  Sciences\nCamp, said: “In a physical camp,\nthere’s a sense of community that cannot be replicated online. It is\nsomething that I’m really looking\nforward to this year.”\nMedical student Donovan Lim,\n20,  an  incoming  freshman  who\ntook part in NUS’ King Edward VII\nHall’s engagement camp on June 1\nand 2, said it left him with a better\nunderstanding of hall life and uni-\nversity life as a whole.\n“A lot of the tips or advice that se-\nniors gave me was when we were\nhaving  organic  conversations,\nwhich could not have happened in\na virtual camp,” he added.\nFor incoming SMU social science\nfreshman Emma Ho, 19, an in-per-\nson event will make it easier for\nher to get to know her peers.\nShe  noted  that  conversations\nfeel more natural in a face-to-face\nsetting than on an online platform.\nSimilarly,  NTU-bound  Jolene\nChia, 19, who is pursuing a double\nmajor in psychology and media an-\nalytics, said: “You can’t feel the\nvibe of the different co-curricular\nactivities online – you need to be\nthere to find the people and envi-\nronment which will suit you the\nbest.”\nBut there are some, like 19-year-\nold Aman Zainal, who prefer a vir-\ntual camp.\n“The large groups will tire me out\nquickly, as  I’m someone  who  is\nmore introverted,” he said.\nThe student from NUS’ College\nof Design and Engineering, who will be entering the university this\nyear, added that the fast-paced ori-\nentation programmes require a lot\nof interaction within a very short\nperiod of time. He prefers to get to\nknow his peers gradually over the\ncourse of a semester.\nFor  the  organisers,  the  relax-\nation of rules will give their pro-\ngrammes an extra buzz.\nStudent Edmund Ong said the or-\nganising  committee  of  the  NUS\nBusiness  Camp  had  to  plan  for\nboth online and in-person scenar-\nios  in  the  light  of  changing\nCovid-19 restrictions over the past\n10 months of planning.\nThe 22-year-old  said  he  is re-\nlieved by the return of face-to-face\norientation, adding: “We felt that\nan  online  event  would  not  give\nfreshmen the full experience, and\nlacked the excitement and fun we\nwanted them to have.”\nHowever, it is not all fun and\ngames in orientation this year.\nSome students who have already\nattended camps noticed that orien-\ntation activities were being con-\nducted  with  extra  precautions\nover  concerns  that  the  camps\ncould be cut short or called off by\nthe school administration – either\nover safe management measures\nbeing  breached  or  over  other\nforms of misbehaviour.\nningchionh@sph.com.sg\nvarunkarthik@sph.com.sg\nIn-person uni orientation\ncamps making a comeback\nStudents\npractising dance\nmoves for the\nNational\nUniversity of\nSingapore’s Rag\nand Flag event\nin 2016.
