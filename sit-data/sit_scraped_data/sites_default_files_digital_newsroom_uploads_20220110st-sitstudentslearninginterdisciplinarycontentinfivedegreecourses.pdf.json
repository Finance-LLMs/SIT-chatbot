But you have to think of\nways to assess the students individ-\nually, although it is a team effort.”\nEach  degree  programme  will\nalso have several complementary\nmodules to further aid students to\nkeep up with changes in a particu-\nlar sector.\nFor  instance,  hospitality  stu-\ndents will take some engineering modules to understand basic robot-\nics, digitalisation and automation –\nall of which are becoming more\nprevalent in the industry.\nProf Chua said he hopes to have\nall programmes contain interdisci-\nplinary modules in the next four\nyears, with more degrees having\nthem from September this year.\nSIT will have 38 undergraduate\nprogrammes in the academic year starting in September.\nProf Chua said that as a univer-\nsity that focuses on applied learn-\ning, SIT’s aim is for graduates to\n“hit  the  ground  running”  when\nthey step into the workforce.\n“We want our education to be as\nauthentic  as  possible,  and  that\nmeans working very closely with in-\ndustry... to expose our students to\nthe kind of problems they will face\nwhen they go to work,” he said.\nAnd  problems  are  becoming\nmore complex, he said, adding that\nissues such as climate change and\nsustainability  require  expertise\nfrom multiple disciplines.\nMore attention will also be given\nto transferable skills, or abilities\nthat are useful across careers. SIT\nhas drawn up a list of 18 such skills\n– from  written  communication\nand digital data literacy to profes-\nsional ethics and self-management\n– that it wants students to learn\nthrough  existing  and  new  mod-\nules.\nStudents will  be  able  to  track\ntheir learning progress through an\napp that will map out the skills they\nhave learnt. The app will be ready\nwithin the next two years.\nInterdisciplinary  learning  has\nbeen of recent interest among uni-\nversities in Singapore.\nThe National University of Singa-\npore admitted the first cohort of\nstudents into its College of Humani-\nties and  Sciences in August last\nyear, bringing together two of its\noldest faculties.\nProf  Chua  said  as  an  applied\nlearning  institution,  SIT’s  ap-\nproach to interdisciplinary learn-\ning is more targeted as it has to en-\nsure that students still gain suffi-\ncient expertise in their specialisa-\ntions without extending their time\nin school.\nIt is not about cramming knowl-\nedge from multiple disciplines into\ntheir university education, he said,\nbut getting students to develop the\nability to interact with people and\njobs across disciplines.\nateng@sph.com.sg First batch to do so enrolled last year; curriculum equips\nthem to handle real-life problems across different fields\nSIT students learning\ninterdisciplinary content\nin five degree courses\nWORK-READY GRADUATES\nWe want our\neducation to be as\nauthentic as possible,\nand that means\nworking very closely\nwith industry.’’SIT PRESIDENT CHUA KEE CHAING\nPublication: The S traits Times\nDate: 10 January 2022\nHeadline: SIT students learning interdisciplinary\ncontent in five degree courses\nSource: The Straits Times © Singapore Press Holdings.
