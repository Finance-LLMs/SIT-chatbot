    "Coaching Students in Higher Education: A Solution-Focused Approach to Retention, Performance and Wellbeing",
    "Routledge, 2024",
    "May Sok Mui Lim, Nadya Shaznay Patel, Ramesh Shahdadpuri",
    "This practical guide for educators in higher education encourages readers to ask effective coaching questions and apply relevant coaching techniques to empower and engage students to grow and perform at their best.",
    "Filled with authentic examples and handy tips, the book takes readers from the ‘how to’ of coaching, through the practicalities, challenges and honing of existing skills and new capabilities. The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.",
    "This is a resourceful text for educators, teachers and professionals working in higher education and learning institutions. It provides training material for institutions that want to conduct faculty development programmes to prepare educators for effective coaching conversations in their universities.",

    "Today, “all institutions of higher education almost everywhere in the world have been influenced by the concept of globalisation. The resulting policy changes in each nation-state have, of course, reflected the degree of the impact of globalisation on the country, hence the changes in higher education.” (Banya, 2005, p.147). This points to globalisation shaping knowledge production as well as the spread of intentional and continuous waves of innovation. The effects of globalisation on education can be seen through a) the changing paradigm from a closed system to a more open system, and b) the changing approach from a teacher-centred learning environment to that of a learner-centred environment. This changing approach culminates in the broader ideas of ‘applied learning’ through a) a productive view of learning versus the reproductive view of learning, b) constructivist versus behaviourist, c) learning facilitation versus teaching, and d) process-based assessment versus outcome-based assessment (Rudic, 2016).",

    "Developing Interactive Oral Assessments to Foster Graduate Attributes in Higher Education",
    "Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 2021",
    "Chin Pei Tan, Dora Howes, Rendell K. W. Tan, Karina M. Dancza",
    "Interactive oral assessments demonstrate potential to develop graduate attributes such as critical thinking, professional communication and collaborative skills in students through authentic simulation of workplace scenarios. This study captured the design, delivery and evaluation of interactive oral assessments across three programmes – occupational therapy, nursing and air transport management – in one university. A four-step Model to Build Authentic Assessment was used to design the assessments. Quantitative and qualitative data collected from 158 students, five assessors and three module leaders were analysed for a basic evaluation of the fidelity of interactive oral assessment implementation across different contexts and to explore the experiences of faculty and students undertaking the assessments. Fidelity was considered in terms of: (i) whether students could express their individualised responses, (ii) if they perceived the assessment to be authentic, and (iii) if it helped them gain professional knowledge and skills. In all the developed assessments, each of the three aspects were somewhat evident, evident or clearly evident. Qualitative findings suggested the interactive oral assessments reflected real-world expectations, promoted deep learning and offered a quality learning experience. From these results, practical suggestions for how faculty can self-assess their readiness for implementing interactive oral assessments are offered.",

    "Effectiveness of AdventureLEARN, an Online Gamified Platform for Improving Approaches to Learning",
    "Asian Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, 2021",
    "Sok Mui Lim, Oran Devilly, Jamil Jasin, Xiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Chek Tien Tan, Yong Lim Foo",
    "The use of gamified tools to increase levels of student engagement has grown in the past decade. The present study examines the effects of a gamified intervention platform, known as AdventureLEARN, on three types of students' approaches to learning: (1) deep, (2) organised, and (3) unreflective approaches. After completing the Approaches to Learning and Studying Inventory (ALSI) on AdventureLEARN, students received a personalised list of learning resources to improve learning approaches, based on their responses on the ALSI. A total of 700 Year One students from Academic Years (AY) 2018 and 2019 participated in this study. Their approaches to learning were measured at the end of Year One. Students who accessed three or more learning resources in AdventureLEARN showed a significant decrease in unreflective approaches to learning after a year, with no significant changes in deep and organised approaches to learning observed. These findings indicate that AdventureLEARN could be a promising gamified platform for reducing students' unreflective approaches to learning. Lastly, the challenge of building a self-driven gamified intervention, rather than a classroom-based intervention, is briefly discussed. The inclusion of additional meaningful gamification techniques that address psychological and social needs are proposed for future research.",

    "Enhancing Interactional Competence Through the Use of English Expressions",
    "International Journal of TESOL Studies, 2021",
    "Junaitha Gaffoor, Padma Rao",
    "An exploratory study was conducted on the use of common English expressions in accountancy and business courses in a Singapore university. The aim of the study was to investigate the use of English expressions required by students to engage in effective communication at their workplace either during their internship period or upon graduation. Data garnered through a quiz, an online survey, semi-structured focus group interviews with students, and face-to face interviews with business professionals were analysed through descriptive statistics and qualitatively to gather the perceptions of students and business professionals on the use of English expressions such as common idioms, proverbs and catchphrases relevant for workplace communication. The study found that students’ interactional competence can be enhanced by increasing their learning engagement through relevant communicative activities that include English expressions in the physical and/or virtual classroom.",

    "Development of Criticality in Thought: A Conceptual Framework for Online Student Discussion Forums in Higher Education",
    "International Journal of TESOL Studies, 2021",
    "Nadya Shaznay Patel",
    "Assessing student understanding and extending student learning beyond the face-to-face or synchronous online lesson is commonly done with the use of online discussion forums. However, the challenge reported by tutors of higher education has always been the lack of active participation and critical engagement by students unless the task is graded formally. Researchers have been investigating various approaches to facilitate effective learning experiences such that students are motivated to engage others when they are tasked to partake in such asynchronous discussions. This paper explores how I sought to engage my Engineering undergraduate students, reading a critical thinking and writing module taught in a blended learning environment, in online discussion forums with the adoption of the Paul-Elder critical thinking framework. The aim was to develop higher levels of criticality in thought in students’ forum responses, while demonstrating the application of the critical thinking tools, such that they were able to collaboratively construct knowledge and deepen their conceptual understanding of Engineering leadership. Results of the analysis found that students were engaged in spontaneous dialogic discussions in the form of repeated extended posts published in the online discussion forums. Furthermore, analysis of student critical reflection essays also confirmed that the online discussion forums, with a deliberate use of the tools of the framework, had contributed to their development of critical thinking skills to deepen their understanding. This paper concludes with a recommendation for tutors of higher education to make the assessment of students’ critical reflection or critical thinking skills visible for students with a proposed conceptual framework for online discussion forums.",

    "Experience of Students in Cooperative Education – A Case Study of Singapore’s Work-study Degree Programme",
    "Journal of Adult and Continuing Education, 2021",
    "Oran Devilly, Jamil Jasin, Sok Mui Lim, Yong Lim Foo",
    "The increase in the number of adults returning to complete their university education as ‘non-traditional students’ brings more attention to the challenges of a standard degree format. This paper examines the experiences of seven non-traditional students undergoing a cooperative education programme in Singapore, where students would alternate spending a few days in a week at a university while working full-time for the remaining days, in relation to the challenges and opportunities of the programme. Using qualitative thematic analysis, we discovered four themes greatly affected by the programme design – motivations for enrolling, transferability of knowledge, work–study balance and coping mechanisms. Overall, some obstacles hindering adults from continuing education were addressed by this cooperative education programme. The strong integration of work and study roles ensured that adults did not need to leave their job before starting university, reducing time and money-related pressures while increasing their commitment level to education. Additionally, rigid institutional practices were mitigated by the flexibility given by teaching faculty and work supervisors. We suggested several improvements to better suit the rising number of adults wanting to attain a degree. With the research results and recommendations proposed herein, this paper is useful to various universities willing to adopt cooperative education.",

    "Occupational Therapy Students’ Experiences of Team-Based Learning: A Multiyear Study",
    "Journal of Occupational Therapy Education, 2021",
    "Bhing Leet Tan, I-Ling Yeh, Phyllis Liang",
    "Many health sciences disciplines have adopted team-based learning (TBL) as part of their education pedagogy, with studies showing increased classroom participation and learner satisfaction. However, it will be beneficial to explore the learning experiences of occupational therapy students in TBL using a mixed methods approach. In an undergraduate occupational therapy program, students undertook three clinical modules using TBL in years two and three. This study explored their perceptions and experiences of TBL. This was a mixed methods prospective cohort study, during which two cohorts of students from Academic Year (AY) 2016 and AY2017 completed the Team-Based Learning Student Assessment Instrument (TBL-SAI) at the end of their first (midway evaluation) and third clinical module (final evaluation). In addition, they completed a semi-structured survey to share their learning experience. One-hundred twenty-seven occupational therapy students from both cohorts had full data and their results showed higher than neutral for Accountability, Preference for TBL, and Student Satisfaction sub-scales and composite scores at midway and final survey. Collectively, there were no significant changes in TBL perceptions, and no significant relationships were found between TBL-SAI scores and module results. Within the AY2017 cohort, there was positive moderate association between Accountability sub-scale midway score and module results. Qualitative analysis produced four themes: 1) power of discussion; 2) time use; 3) changed learning process and outcome; and 4) tailoring aspects of TBL to enhance learning. Occupational therapy students’ scores in the TBL-SAI domains were higher than neutral at midway and final evaluation. TBL may be a suitable method to aid learning of clinical occupational therapy knowledge.",

After completing the Approaches to Learning and Studying Inventory (ALSI) on AdventureLEARN, students received a personalised list of learning resources to improve learning approaches, based on their responses on the ALSI. A total of 700 Year One students from Academic Years (AY) 2018 and 2019 participated in this study. Their approaches to learning were measured at the end of Year One. Students who accessed three or more learning resources in AdventureLEARN showed a significant decrease in unreflective approaches to learning after a year, with no significant changes in deep and organised approaches to learning observed. These findings indicate that AdventureLEARN could be a promising gamified platform for reducing students' unreflective approaches to learning. Lastly, the challenge of building a self-driven gamified intervention, rather than a classroom-based intervention, is briefly discussed. The inclusion of additional meaningful gamification techniques that address psychological and social needs are proposed for future research.",
    "An exploratory study was conducted on the use of common English expressions in accountancy and business courses in a Singapore university. The aim of the study was to investigate the use of English expressions required by students to engage in effective communication at their workplace either during their internship period or upon graduation. Data garnered through a quiz, an online survey, semi-structured focus group interviews with students, and face-to face interviews with business professionals were analysed through descriptive statistics and qualitatively to gather the perceptions of students and business professionals on the use of English expressions such as common idioms, proverbs and catchphrases relevant for workplace communication. The study found that students’ interactional competence can be enhanced by increasing their learning engagement through relevant communicative activities that include English expressions in the physical and/or virtual classroom.",
    "Assessing student understanding and extending student learning beyond the face-to-face or synchronous online lesson is commonly done with the use of online discussion forums. However, the challenge reported by tutors of higher education has always been the lack of active participation and critical engagement by students unless the task is graded formally. Researchers have been investigating various approaches to facilitate effective learning experiences such that students are motivated to engage others when they are tasked to partake in such asynchronous discussions. This paper explores how I sought to engage my Engineering undergraduate students, reading a critical thinking and writing module taught in a blended learning environment, in online discussion forums with the adoption of the Paul-Elder critical thinking framework. The aim was to develop higher levels of criticality in thought in students’ forum responses, while demonstrating the application of the critical thinking tools, such that they were able to collaboratively construct knowledge and deepen their conceptual understanding of Engineering leadership. Results of the analysis found that students were engaged in spontaneous dialogic discussions in the form of repeated extended posts published in the online discussion forums. Furthermore, analysis of student critical reflection essays also confirmed that the online discussion forums, with a deliberate use of the tools of the framework, had contributed to their development of critical thinking skills to deepen their understanding. This paper concludes with a recommendation for tutors of higher education to make the assessment of students’ critical reflection or critical thinking skills visible for students with a proposed conceptual framework for online discussion forums.",
    "The increase in the number of adults returning to complete their university education as ‘non-traditional students’ brings more attention to the challenges of a standard degree format. This paper examines the experiences of seven non-traditional students undergoing a cooperative education programme in Singapore, where students would alternate spending a few days in a week at a university while working full-time for the remaining days, in relation to the challenges and opportunities of the programme. Using qualitative thematic analysis, we discovered four themes greatly affected by the programme design – motivations for enrolling, transferability of knowledge, work–study balance and coping mechanisms. Overall, some obstacles hindering adults from continuing education were addressed by this cooperative education programme. The strong integration of work and study roles ensured that adults did not need to leave their job before starting university, reducing time and money-related pressures while increasing their commitment level to education. Additionally, rigid institutional practices were mitigated by the flexibility given by teaching faculty and work supervisors. We suggested several improvements to better suit the rising number of adults wanting to attain a degree. With the research results and recommendations proposed herein, this paper is useful to various universities willing to adopt cooperative education.",
    "Many health sciences disciplines have adopted team-based learning (TBL) as part of their education pedagogy, with studies showing increased classroom participation and learner satisfaction. However, it will be beneficial to explore the learning experiences of occupational therapy students in TBL using a mixed methods approach. In an undergraduate occupational therapy program, students undertook three clinical modules using TBL in years two and three. This study explored their perceptions and experiences of TBL. This was a mixed methods prospective cohort study, during which two cohorts of students from Academic Year (AY) 2016 and AY2017 completed the Team-Based Learning Student Assessment Instrument (TBL-SAI) at the end of their first (midway evaluation) and third clinical module (final evaluation). In addition, they completed a semi-structured survey to share their learning experience. One-hundred twenty-seven occupational therapy students from both cohorts had full data and their results showed higher than neutral for Accountability, Preference for TBL, and Student Satisfaction sub-scales and composite scores at midway and final survey. Collectively, there were no significant changes in TBL perceptions, and no significant relationships were found between TBL-SAI scores and module results. Within the AY2017 cohort, there was positive moderate association between Accountability sub-scale midway score and module results. Qualitative analysis produced four themes: 1) power of discussion; 2) time use; 3) changed learning process and outcome; and 4) tailoring aspects of TBL to enhance learning. Occupational therapy students’ scores in the TBL-SAI domains were higher than neutral at midway and final evaluation. TBL may be a suitable method to aid learning of clinical occupational therapy knowledge.",

The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.\nThis is a resourceful text for educators, teachers and professionals working in higher education and learning institutions. It provides training material for institutions that want to conduct faculty development programmes to prepare educators for effective coaching conversations in their universities.\nVIEW BOOK\nApplied Learning in Higher Education: Perspective, Pedagogy, and Practice\nInforming Science, 2020\nSok Mui Lim, Yong Lim Foo, Han Tong Loh, Xudong Deng\nToday, “all institutions of higher education almost everywhere in the world have been influenced by the concept of globalisation. The resulting policy changes in each nation-state have, of course, reflected the degree of the impact of globalisation on the country, hence the changes in higher education.” (Banya, 2005, p.147). This points to globalisation shaping knowledge production as well as the spread of intentional and continuous waves of innovation. The effects of globalisation on education can be seen through a) the changing paradigm from a closed system to a more open system, and b) the changing approach from a teacher-centred learning environment to that of a learner-centred environment. This changing approach culminates in the broader ideas of ‘applied learning’ through a) a productive view of learning versus the reproductive view of learning, b) constructivist versus behaviourist, c) learning facilitation versus teaching, and d) process-based assessment versus outcome-based assessment (Rudic, 2016).\nVIEW E-BOOK\nVIEW E-BOOK (FOR SIT STAFF ONLY)\nAll Publications\nShowing\n19\n-\n24\nof\n31\nresults\nDeveloping Interactive Oral Assessments to Foster Graduate Attributes in Higher Education\nAssessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 2021\nChin Pei Tan, Dora Howes, Rendell K. W. Tan, Karina M. Dancza\nInteractive oral assessments demonstrate potential to develop graduate attributes such as critical thinking, professional communication and collaborative skills in students through authentic simulation of workplace scenarios. This study captured the design, delivery and evaluation of interactive oral assessments across three programmes – occupational therapy, nursing and air transport management – in one university. A four-step Model to Build Authentic Assessment was used to design the assessments. Quantitative and qualitative data collected from 158 students, five assessors and three module leaders were analysed for a basic evaluation of the fidelity of interactive oral assessment implementation across different contexts and to explore the experiences of faculty and students undertaking the assessments. Fidelity was considered in terms of: (i) whether students could express their individualised responses, (ii) if they perceived the assessment to be authentic, and (iii) if it helped them gain professional knowledge and skills. In all the developed assessments, each of the three aspects were somewhat evident, evident or clearly evident. Qualitative findings suggested the interactive oral assessments reflected real-world expectations, promoted deep learning and offered a quality learning experience. From these results, practical suggestions for how faculty can self-assess their readiness for implementing interactive oral assessments are offered.\nLaunch\nVIEW PAPER\nEffectiveness of AdventureLEARN, an Online Gamified Platform for Improving Approaches to Learning\nAsian Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, 2021\nSok Mui Lim, Oran Devilly, Jamil Jasin, Xiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Chek Tien Tan, Yong Lim Foo\nThe use of gamified tools to increase levels of student engagement has grown in the past decade.
