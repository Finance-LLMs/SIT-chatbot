    "Physiotherapy\n Modules",
    "Year 1 (Trimester 1)",
    "Anatomy and Physiology 1",
    "HSC1001",
    "This module, together with Anatomy and Physiology 2 (HSC1002), will equip students with a working knowledge of the normal structure and function of the human body. The clinical relevance and the interrelationship between different body systems will be emphasized. Learning of anatomical structures will be reinforced by highlighting connections with their physiological functions. In this module, students will learn the anatomy and physiology of blood, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, nervous system, integumentary system, and the musculoskeletal system. They will also gain an in-depth understanding of the musculoskeletal anatomy of the upper and lower extremities.",
    "Psychological and Sociological Perspectives for Health Sciences",
    "HSC1004",
    "This module consists of two components: sociological and psychological perspectives. It is designed for students in their first year of undergraduate studies so that they are equipped with fundamental knowledge for modules in subsequent trimesters. Sociology is the study of society, relationships, and social behaviour. Students will consider key sociological concepts and research to broaden their understanding of health, illness, and healthcare as they relate to the individual, family, and society. Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and the behaviour. In this module, students will attain in-depth understanding of the fundamental psychological concepts, as well as their applications to both the experimental and the clinical settings, enriching their skillset as health professionals and researchers. This module will encompass the central psychological domains: biological, behavioural, cognitive, personality, emotions, and mental health. In addition to the applied learning focus pertaining to health, this module is designed to foster critical thinking. Learning activities include viewing recorded lectures, reading textbooks, accessing e-materials and participating in synchronous seminars.",
    "Health Systems - Singapore's Perspectives",
    "HSC1006",
    "The World Health Organization (WHO)’s framework of a health system includes resource generation, stewardship, funding and provisioning. The goal of a health system is to improve health, respond to expectations and focus on fairness in financial contribution. In this module, the Singapore health system is described and analyzed within the WHO’s framework. Students will learn to appreciate how policies are developed, health needs identified and met, intersectoral collaborations needed and established, and services organized and evaluated. Through interprofessional studies, they will learn about the needs of patients and the roles of different professions in the health systems addressing those needs.",
    "Foundation of Physiotherapy 1: Movement",
    "PTY1011",
    "This module introduces the science and practice of contemporary physiotherapy based on human movement. Students will develop an understanding of professionalism issues, the therapeutic alliance and reflective practice in delivering evidence informed, person-centred practice. The module examines appropriate communication and the use of movement as the basis for physiotherapeutic interventions. Biomechanics will be included to guide understanding of human movements. Students will integrate biomechanical principles to apply in manual handling and transfers and use of mobility aids. Students will be introduced to the basics of therapeutic touch with surface anatomy.",
    "Year 1 (Trimester 2)",
    "Anatomy and Physiology 2",
    "HSC1002",
    "In this module, we’ll be building up on Anatomy and Physiology 1 (HSC1001) to provide students with the practical knowledge of the normal structure and function of the human body. The clinical relevance and the interrelationship between different body systems will be emphasized. Learning of anatomical structures will be reinforced by highlighting connections with their physiological functions. In this module, students will learn the anatomy and physiology of the digestive system, endocrine system, renal system, immune system and reproductive system. They will also gain an in-depth understanding of the musculoskeletal anatomy of the thorax, abdomen, head and neck.",
    "Foundation of Physiotherapy 2: Kinesiology",
    "PTY1012",
    "The scientific study of human movements is the foundation of physiotherapy practice. In this module, students will learn kinesiology terminology, osteokinematics and arthrokinematics, muscle actions and motor control principles, all of which are fundamental to the understanding of human movements. Students will develop practical skills to define and analyse movements, including observation, goniometry and manual muscle testing. An important application of kinesiology is movement analysis of common functional, sports and recreational activities, which is central to physiotherapy diagnosis and practice.",
    "Foundation of Physiotherapy 3: Clinical Application",
    "PTY1013",
    "The module covers an introduction to the selection and clinical application of a range of physiotherapy treatment modes – education, exercise, electrophysical agents and manual therapies. Theoretical knowledge on the physiological effects and current evidence of efficacy of commonly used treatment modes will be explored. Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of clinical reasoning to guide their decisions on treatment selection followed by practical application of treatment skills in lab classes.",
    "Year 1 (Trimester 3)",
    "Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy (Extremities)",
    "PTY1008",
    "The module on musculoskeletal physiotherapy (extremities) will focus on the development of critical thinking in diagnosis and practical skills in physiotherapy assessment and treatment of common musculoskeletal conditions. Students will be introduced to the different musculoskeletal conditions affecting the upper and lower limbs, alongside the relevant physical assessment and evidence based treatment approaches for these conditions. Clinical case studies will be used to apply the theories in the appropriate contexts of physiotherapy practice. The module will cover topics on effective communication in clinical interview, clinical reasoning skills, physical examination skills, treatment and manual handling skills for physiotherapy in the musculoskeletal context.",
    "Exercise Physiology",
    "PTY1014",
    "This module aims to introduce the role and purpose of exercise physiology. Applied physiology and the impact of exercise or activity on our physiological system provide the basic principles of physiotherapy management in managing chronic diseases. Exercise Physiology is a module to empower physiotherapists with the delivery and modification of exercise, lifestyle, and behavioural modification programs. This module will explore the concepts underpinning current approaches to the assessment of cardiovascular fitness, strength and flexibility; a deeper understanding of healthy and untrained individuals’ physiological responses to acute and chronic exercise; and prescription of specific and effective exercise programs. There will be analysis of the supporting theory and available evidence alongside with practical application of assessment and management techniques.",
    "Significant emphasis will be placed on the development of clinical reasoning in the evaluation and management of patients with various chronic diseases in addition to other co-morbidities. Students will be encouraged to critically appraise and evaluate the theory, evidence-base and practical application of current delivery and modification of exercise, lifestyle and behavioural modifications for prevention and effective management of chronic diseases and co-morbidities.",
    "Year 2 (Trimester 1)",
    "Cardiopulmonary Physiotherapy",
    "PTY2001",
    "This module is designed to achieve entry level physiotherapy competency and clinical skills in cardiopulmonary physiotherapy. The module explores the role of cardiopulmonary physiotherapy, integrating skills and techniques, theoretical concepts, clinical reasoning and the evolving body of knowledge from the current evidence. The module provide emphasis on the management, with focus on the management of acute cardiopulmonary conditions.",
