The kids cannot\nchange those settings unless they\nknow their parents’ passwords.\nYue Heng’s father Liu Kerh Lisaid that shortly after his son, now\n14, got his phone, the teen’s screen\ntime shot up with a flurry of activi-\nties on social media and chat apps.\nThe  43-year-old  manager\nstarted to set screen-time limits on\nYue Heng’s phone when he felt his\nson’s  phone  usage  had  become\nexcessive.\nMadam Reine Lee Hui Siam, 44, a\nsocial  worker,  relies  on  Google\nFamily  Link,  a  parental  control\napp, to set time limits and lock her\nchildren’s phones when they are\nnot supposed  to be using them.\nBoth her children, aged 13 and 16,\nhave their own phones now.\nShe said: “I was reluctant to give\nthem a phone and I tried to delay\ngiving one for as long as possible.\n“However,  once  they  entered\nsecondary school, it became neces-\nsary for them to have one. A lot of\ninformation is passed through on-\nline chats by teachers and class-\nmates. It’s no longer like in primary\nschool when parents are informed\nby the school for everything.\n“But a phone comes with a lot of\ndistractions  on  the  Internet  or\nfrom games. There’s a lot of expo-\nsure that could be harmful.”\nProfessor Hee Jhee Jiow, a mem-\nber of the Media Literacy Council,\nencourages parents to use parental\ncontrol apps for their children to\nteach self-restraint.\n“Young children may not have\nthe maturity to control their own\nphone usage,” he said.\nParents should avoid being poor\nrole models, comparing their chil-\ndren with their peers, and not mak-\ning an effort to understand theirneeds, when it comes to managing\ntheir phone usage, he added.\nMr Chong Ee Jay, deputy head at\nFamChamps, a community youth\nmovement, said: “It is necessary to\nuse parental control apps. When\nthey are still young, you want to\nmake sure to regulate their phone\nusage because they may not under-\nstand how to themselves.”\nBut be careful not to “outsource”\nparenting to these apps, Mr Chong\nwarned.\n“Engaging the child in conversa-\ntions is still needed. There needs to\nbe a balance between a talking-\ndown approach and having open\nconversation.”\nHe  recommends  that  parents\nhave discussions with their chil-\ndren at least once a week about\ntechnology, on topics such as thechallenges they face or fun things\nabout tech.\nHe advises  parents with older\nchildren to adjust the boundaries\naccordingly. “They already hear a\nlot from the school on the dos and\ndon’ts.  A  relational  approach  is\nwhat they need at home.”\nThe  reality  is  that  children’s\nscreen time will increase as they\nstay home more often during the\npandemic, he said, urging parents\nto think of how to help them make\nbetter  use  of  their  time  on  the\ndevices.\n“Engage with them and find out\nwhat they do. Children these days\nfigure out a lot of things by them-\nselves on the phone, like video-\nediting, digital scrapbooking and\nlearning how  to  code.  Be  inter-\nested,” he added.Apps that regulate kids’ use of phones\nMr Liu Kerh Li uses screen-time limits to help manage the mobile phone\nusage of his son, Yue Heng (both above).
