We will continue to expand the\nCSM pathway with new programmes such as the Bachelor of\nEngineering (Honours) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering\nand the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Infrastructure\nand Systems Engineering.\nThe implementation of the CSM pathway coincides with the\nlaunch of the SIT Teaching and Learning Academy (STLA).\nThe academy champions competency-based education (CBE)\nto enhance learning outcomes. A key focus of STLA is the\nRecognition of Prior Learning (RPL) framework, which facilitates\nthe acquisition of new competencies and qualifications.\nThis approach empowers learners to build on their existing\nknowledge and experience.\nEXPANDING EDUCATIONAL HORIZONS\nAND INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS\nLooking ahead, we’re excited to launch new programmes\nsuch as the Integrated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)\n- Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) programme in AY2024.\nThis initiative, developed in collaboration with SingHealth,\nstrengthens our commitment to healthcare by nurturing\nspecialist nurses and future leaders. We are also expanding\npostgraduate offerings with the Master of Health Sciences\n(MHSc) programme in AY2024, specifically catering to graduates\nand experienced healthcare professionals who wish to further\ntheir studies and enhance their skills.SIT’s success hinges on our unique applied learning model,\nfuelled by strong industry collaborations. These partnerships\ninform curriculum development, ensure its relevance to\nindustry needs, and provide students access to a vast\nnetwork of companies for placements and research projects.\nBy strategically focusing on growth sectors aligned with\nSingapore’s future economic roadmap, we empower our\nSITizens with the most sought-after skills.\nREAL-WORLD LEARNING: BRIDGING THE\nGAP BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE\nOur focus on applied learning means that we not only\nblend real-world cases into the curriculum, but also look\nfor opportunities for our students to apply their learning to\nsocietal challenges. Our Social Innovation Project (SIP) module\nallows students to tackle real-world problems, particularly in\nthe areas of sustainability and social innovation. For instance,\nthis year, our students participated in the inaugural Overseas\nImmersion Programme to Indonesia and Cambodia to embark\non their SIP. During their trips, they conducted fieldwork and\nground sensing, engaging with residents to co-create solutions\nfor challenges faced by the local communities.\nENRICHING THE SITIZEN EXPERIENCE\nBeyond academics, the University renamed its Student Life\nDivision (SLD) the Office of SITizen Experience (OSE) to better\nreflect the expanded role of the division in delivering an\nenhanced SITizen experience, which stretches from the day our\nstudents matriculate, to after they graduate and become our\nalumni. An experience which truly delivers on the promise of “Once a SITizen, always a SITizen”. OSE fosters the development\nof well-rounded individuals by nurturing distinct human\nattributes that complement technology. This enables students\nand graduates to be future leaders and change agents who\nwill transform lives and uplift communities.\nLEADING THE WAY IN APPLIED RESEARCH\nThe University is also steadily building its applied research\nactivities, collaborating with other institutions and industry\npartners. We participated in a consortium led by mobility\nsolutions provider Strides to develop and test-bed Vehicle-\nto-Grid (V2G) technologies, the largest V2G testbed in\nSingapore. Additionally, together with tech giant NVIDIA, we\nhave established an Artificial Intelligence (AI) centre that will\ndevelop research talent and collaborate on AI innovation and\ndeployment. The centre will also help to bolster AI adoption\nacross industries by offering comprehensive end-to-end\ntechnological support, innovative solutions, and co-supervision\nby SIT and NVIDIA experts to industry partners.\nGRATITUDE AND LOOKING FORWARD\nWe are able to do all this thanks to our dedicated faculty, staff\nand students, who are the backbone of SIT. Their unwavering\ncommitment to excellence fuels our success. We are also\ngrateful to our industry and community partners, government\nagencies, and all who have supported our journey. As we look\nahead, fuelled by this incredible network of support, we are\nfilled with optimism for the future. We are confident that SIT\nwill continue to thrive and empower future generations to\nmake a positive impact on Singapore and the world./09\nSINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nEXPANDING OUR HORIZONS:\nNEW EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS\nRecognising the evolving and growing needs of learners\nand industry, SIT has expanded our mission beyond pre-\nemployment training. Working closely with industry, we\ndeveloped the Competency-based Stackable Micro-credential\n(CSM) pathway, offering in-employment learners the\nopportunity to acquire in-demand skills just in time. This\nallows for quicker application of knowledge to address industry\nneeds. It also gives learners the option to build towards a\ndegree, catering to their growing need for flexibility when\nembarking on lifelong learning.\nINDUSTRY COLLABORATION:\nA CORNERSTONE OF SUCCESS\nCollaboration with industry continues to be a cornerstone of\nour success. The curriculum for all our programmes, including\nthe upcoming CSM Engineering degree programmes, is\nco-developed with industry partners. This ensures that\nour graduates always possess the skills and knowledge\nmost desired by employers and helps industry build their\ntalent pipeline.A DECADE OF IMPACT:\nCELEBRATING SIT’S 10TH ANNIVERSARY\nAs SIT commemorates its 10th anniversary as an Autonomous\nUniversity (AU) in 2024, I am filled with pride and gratitude\nfor all that our faculty, staff, students, alumni and partners\nhave accomplished together. SIT has witnessed remarkable\ngrowth, achieved significant milestones and most importantly,\nmade a positive impact on the lives of our students, as well\nas industry and community partners.\nFROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH:\nGROWING OUR STUDENT BODY\nOur student body has grown significantly. From admitting\n1,800 students at the start of our journey as an AU in 2014,\nour current intake exceeds 3,300 – making us the third\nlargest AU for full-time undergraduate intake in Singapore.\nThe achievements of our graduates reflect the quality of\neducation we provide. Graduate employment surveys\nover the years consistently show over 90% employment\nrates, with about half of our students receiving advance\njob offers through our signature Integrated Work Study\nProgramme (IWSP).\nWE ARE DEVELOPING A MODEL FOR ENGAGED LEARNING, PARTNERING WITH\nSECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE PUNGGOL REGION TO USE STEM SKILLS TO SOLVE\nREAL-WORLD PROBLEMS. THIS WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY, BUT\nALSO GENERATE INTEREST IN STEM AMONG THE YOUTH, AS WELL AS PROVIDE\nVALUABLE LEADERSHIP AND FACILITATION EXPERIENCE FOR OUR STUDENTS.”PROFESSOR CHUA\nKEE CHAING\nPresident “PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE/10\nSINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nRESEARCH THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE\nOur industry partnerships extend to the realm of applied\nresearch, where we prioritise a close nexus between research\nand education.
