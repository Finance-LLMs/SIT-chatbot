    "Future Communications Translation Lab (FCTLab) at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) was established to facilitate the innovation and technology translation of 5G and other future communication technologies.",
    "Overview",
    "Since its establishment in 2021, the FCTLab has actively sought partnerships in 5G test bedding, translation research in 5G connectivity, 5G application prototyping, and security.",
    "Two 5G testbeds have been set up at the SIT@Dover campus in collaboration with industry partners, one based on a multi-vendor open network solution and the other based on a single-vendor solution for 5G translational research and development (R&D).",
    "Accessing a dedicated 5G testbed at FCTLab allows users to customise solutions freely, breaking the reliance on predefined telco configurations. The multi-vendor setup promotes innovation, and faster service deployment, offering users a secured and controlled space for 5G solutions development.",
    "FCTLab provides a range of services, including testbed-as-a-service, modelling and simulation, use-case development and prototyping. The live network infrastructure at SIT@Dover campus provides a collaborative platform for industry and researchers to exchange ideas, share best practices, and co-create innovative solutions.",
    "Our Aims",
    "The FCTLab is set up to accelerate research on use cases and strengthen translational capabilities to ensure that we maximise the potential of future communications technologies.",
    "To build modelling and simulation platforms, open 5G standalone testbed, with test and measurement capabilities.",
    "To strengthen demand-led research and innovation with the aim of co-creation and commercialisation of IP.",
    "To facilitate and enable open innovation, learning, testing and validating of 5G technologies and use cases, solve pain points from industry and agencies in their 5G deployment for use cases.",
    "To strengthen capability transfer from RIs/IHLs and/or MNCs to locally based companies.",
    "What We Do",
    "We invite companies to conduct",
    "5G translation projects",
    ", with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 4 to 7, using our testbeds. This can involve testing of new technologies, evaluating network performance, and exploring innovative 5G use cases specific to your industry. FCTLab provides access to physical and virtual 5G network infrastructure, including base stations, core network components, and associated network functions. Users can experiment with different network configurations, protocols, and services.",
    "Companies can leverage our testbeds for:",
    "· Proof-of-concept",
    "· Showcase the capabilities of 5G technology through live demonstrations",
    "· End-to-end validation for products and services before commercialisation",
    "We invite companies to experience the benefits of 5G and explore how it can transform your business processes and operations with us.",
    "The testbeds offer",
    "network-slicing",
    "services allowing users to create and manage virtual network slices with specific characteristics and requirements. This facilitates the testing and evaluation of network slicing concepts, service isolation, and resource management. Virtualised network slices can be created and tailored to different industry requirements.",
    "Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC)",
    "enables the deployment of applications and services at the network edge, closer to end-users, reducing network congestion and enabling faster response time for critical applications. AI and machine learning models can also be hosted in the MEC. This supports applications like predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and intelligent decision-making in edge environments.",
