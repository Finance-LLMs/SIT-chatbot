    "Dr. Ho Jiahui is an Assistant Professor at Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). She obtained her PhD in Geotechnical Engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and started her career as a research fellow working on National Research Foundation (NRF) and Land Transport Authority (LTA) projects.  Her research involved deterministic and random finite element analysis of optimized ground improvement schemes, and experimental study on the application of cementitious binders and additives for large-scale urban space exploitation in soft soil conditions. In the area of geotechnics, Dr Ho has a strong interest in soil improvement and geotechnical earthquake engineering. She served as a reviewer for several publications in ASTM’s Geotechnical Testing Journal (American Society for Testing and Materials) and the Journal of Earthquake and Tsunami. Dr. Ho is currently researching on the application of an advanced piling technology in Singapore.",
