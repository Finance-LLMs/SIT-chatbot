    "The workshop aims to equip healthcare professionals with interdisciplinary knowledge and skills in basic cognitive-perceptual assessments and intervention strategies.",
    "This 5 half-day online introductory workshop is targeted at occupational therapists, nurse clinicians, and other allied health professionals who are working with cognitive-perceptual issues seen in persons with a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions.",
    "It will equip participants with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and address cognitive and perceptual problems across different diagnostic categories.",
    "By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to explain how functional cognition, perception, and executive dysfunction impact daily functioning, and conduct simple cognitive screening. Additionally, they will learn how to apply basic cognitive strategies as part of multi-disciplinary interventions, enabling them to develop more effective and holistic approaches to address cognitive and perceptual challenges.",

    "It was great to go through this workshop. It has helped me reflect on how in-depth I really go when assessing cognition in a hospital ward setting. It has taught me the importance of really identifying the root impairment as patients can present with a multitude of cognitive problems. I have also learnt to be more aware of the cognitive errors displayed across all performance areas for a patient in order to be able to provide the appropriate intervention. It was really interesting and enlightening.",
    "Suhailah Shukor",
    "Senior Occupational Therapist, Institute of Mental Health",
    "This course has been very helpful for me to delve deeper into meta-cognition, even though I may not be in occupational therapy. I can see how I can incorporate what I have learnt for my therapy sessions and this helps me understand the language of other members of the multi-disciplinary team. I appreciate the videos, sharings, and the very comprehensive slides.",
    "Celine Tay",
    "Senior Physiotherapist, Tan Tock Seng Hospital",
    "Prof Toglia gave very up-to-date literature to support the multi-context interventions across disciplines beyond neurology and highlighted the importance of addressing cognitive issues even ICUs and other acute specialties. She supported her teaching very well with videos of patients and interventions. She gave ample worksheets for us to practice our knowledge and also spent ample time addressing our questions. Would definitely recommend it to colleagues in other disciplines so that we could adopt an interdisciplinary intervention.",
    "She also shared resources extensively which are definitely great for clinical applications.",
