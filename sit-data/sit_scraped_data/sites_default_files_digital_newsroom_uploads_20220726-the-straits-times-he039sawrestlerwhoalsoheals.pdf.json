To pay it for-\nward, I decided that being one my-\nself would allow me to help fellow\nathletes too,” he said.\nSo, he applied to the Singapore\nInstitute of  Technology  in 2017,\nand was offered a healthcare schol-\narship  via  the  MOH  Holdings’\nHealthcare Merit Award. He then\nchose to work at CGH for its exper-tise in sports medicine and rehabili-\ntation.\nLou  says:  “Since  I  started  my\nphysiotherapy career  at  CGH  in\n2021, I find satisfaction in helping\npatients to regain their function\nand quality of life. There is this say-\ning that doctors add years to life\nwhile physiotherapists add life to\nyears.\n“I still hope to specialise in sports\nphysiotherapy as it will be highly\nrelatable for me as an athlete and it\nwill put me in a position to provide\nfirst-hand experience and advice\nto my patients.”\nHis intimate knowledge of phys-\niotherapy and sports science, com-\nbined with his collaboration with\nthe Singapore Sports Institute to\nwork on technique and strategy,\nhave also helped him become a\nmore efficient athlete.\n“It allows me to better under-\nstand wrestling in terms of biome-\nchanics, sports performances and\ninjury prevention, which is what\nwe  learn  in  school,  and  do  at\nwork,”  says  Lou,  who  readilyshares  his  knowledge  with  his\nteammates as well.\nAs a teenager, Lou was already\nenamoured with martial arts, start-\ning out with wushu while in sec-\nondary school, before dabbling in\ncombat sports such as mixed mar-\ntial  arts,  Brazilian  jiu-jitsu,  and\nmuay thai.\nHe eventually found his feet in\nwrestling after being introduced to\nthe sport when he was 19 and was\nscouted for the national team the\nfollowing year.\nLou says: “There is just some-\nthing special about the feeling of\nbeing  able  to  strategically  out-\nsmart and outmuscle an opponent\ninto a takedown or a pin, as well as\nthe raw hustle and grind of such\none-on-one physical combat... ap-\nplying  techniques,  tactics,  and  strategies under physical and men-\ntal pressure.”\nHis fighting spirit has not just led\nhim  to  become  the  national\nwrestling captain, but he will also\nbe part of the three-person contin-\ngent who will become Singapore’s\nfirst  Commonwealth  Games\nwrestlers.\nLou says: “My earlier successes\nin  the  local  wrestling  scene\nspurred me to develop further in\nthis sport, and it has always been\nmy dream to represent Singapore\nin the major Games. To be among\nthe first Singaporean wrestlers at\nthe  Commonwealth  Games  is  a\nhuge honour.”\nAnd just like how it is better to go\nthrough rehabilitation from injury\nwith a physiotherapist, the athlete\nin Lou is appreciative of the sup-\nport he has received from the small\nwrestling community despite it be-\ning an individual sport.\n“You can only be as good as your\ntraining partners. I cannot imagine\nbeing a wrestler without this com-\nmunity — we have a shared iden-\ntity,” he says. “They are the team-\nmates and friends whom I hustled\nwith  together  in  the  gym,  and\nshared my joys in victory and sor-\nrows in defeat.\n“The support and opportunities\npresented to me by the wrestling\ncommunity have driven me to do\nmy  best  to try and  achieve  my\nfullest potential, and I am looking\nforward to seeing where I stand at\nthe Commonwealth level.”\ndavidlee@sph.com.sgAhead of the Commonwealth Games,\nSingaporean wrestler Lou Hong Yeow\ntrains from 6.30-8am and 7-9pm\nevery week day, in between his day\njob as a physiotherapist.\nST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO AND\nCHONG JUN LIANGFast, strong, and\nfocused, the 67\nSingaporeans in nine\nsports competing at\nthe Commonwealth\nGames in\nBirmingham are an\nuncommon breed.\nAhead of the\nquadrennial event’s\nopening on Thursday,\nThe Straits Times\nfeatures six athletes\nwho are unique in\ntheir own ways, be it\nin their choice of\nprofessions, personal\nlives or their sporting\njourneys.
