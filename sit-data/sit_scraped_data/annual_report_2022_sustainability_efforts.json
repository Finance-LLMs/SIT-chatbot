    "SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY",
    "SIT aims to develop sustainability talent, ensure a sustainable future for SIT, and contribute to Singapore’s sustainability goals.",

    "Awards for Development",
    "SIT received the ABC Waters Certified (Gold) Award at the Active Beautiful Clean (ABC) Waters Seminar 2022 for the planned design features in its upcoming Punggol Campus East and West Zones. These features, including detention eco-ponds, rain gardens, and cleansing biotopes, are part of the University’s rain harvesting and sustainable stormwater management efforts, and will be seamlessly integrated into the campus to provide a scenic backdrop for the SIT community.",
    "In addition, SIT also attained the BCA Universal Design (UD) Mark GoldPLUS (Design) Award in recognition of its adoption of a user-centric philosophy in its design, operations, and maintenance.",
    "Reducing Carbon Footprint With Renewable Energy",
    "(Read more)",
    "All SIT buildings in our Punggol Campus will meet BCA Green Mark Platinum standards, with two slated to achieve Super Low Energy status. One prominent green feature of the campus will be the Multi-Energy Microgrid (MEMG). The MEMG will be equipped with low carbon technology of various photovoltaics (PV) systems such as Roof-top PV, Building-Integrated PV and PV Thermal, which can convert sunlight to electricity. Read more about the MEMG here.",
    "A feature pond with lush landscaping greets visitors at the main entrance to SIT Punggol Campus (East Zone).",
    "Air-Purification System",
    "Our Punggol Campus will be equipped with an air-purification system (APS) to provide clean indoor air campus-wide in the event of haze and pandemic outbreaks. The APS can effectively screen out viruses and bacteria in the air to significantly reduce the risk of disease transmission, as well as improve indoor air quality.",
    "Integrated Building And Security Management Systems",
    "Management System (IBMS) and Integrated Security Management System (ISMS) is being set up to manage operations in the future 9-ha Punggol Campus. The IBMS allows all building systems to be connected seamlessly through the Internet of Things (IoT) technology to optimise the physical environment, enhance campus experience, and workspace efficiency.",
