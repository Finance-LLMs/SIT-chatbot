    "Abstract",
    "Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging area that is expected to revolutionise the way information is processed in comparison to classical computing methods. According to the literature, investments in quantum technology could reach US$65 billion by 2030. In fact, industry funding is projected to exceed government spending in this area. Therefore, a well-trained workforce is now required to transfer quantum science into commercial products. However, despite the majority of these industries advertising and seeking employees with degrees in Computer Science and/or Electronics Engineering, most of these industries still hire Physics graduates. This is perhaps attributed to the lack of “Quantum” knowledge and skills available in these degree programmes. Moreover, quantum computing is conceptually challenging to understand due to the complex mathematics, physics, and multidisciplinary knowledge involved. Currently, the lack of in-depth Quantum computing knowledge in our university curricula is creating a barrier for those trying to learn and understand the technology. Furthermore, while it is recognised that authentic, experiential learning through access to real, hands-on equipment enhances the applied learning process for students, it takes time and money to setup new educational instruments and facilities for Quantum computing. Not every institution can receive sufficient financial budget to build the necessary facilities for the teaching and education of Quantum computing. Therefore, to meet the needs of industry, the aim of this project is twofold: firstly, to co-create engaging Quantum computing course content that is specifically tailored to Computer Science and Electronics Engineering students; and secondly, to overcome the lack of expensive physical infrastructure by leveraging effective digital tools. To address this, we aim to develop bespoke course content, amounting to an undergraduate university module, that uses high-quality computer simulations with immersive Virtual reality (VR), Augmented reality (AR)), and Mixed Reality (MR) (collectively known as Extended Reality (XR)) technology. In this way, students can get the learning opportunities to develop knowledge and skills in Quantum computing in the virtual world, without being impeded by the costs and time required for real facilities to be set up in schools. In fact, the project involves creating teaching materials of Quantum computing that engage students in fun, interactive, and hands-on ways through compelling visual and graphic materials using modern ICT technologies. Game-based elements, leveraging the XR platforms, will also be employed to enhance the student learning experience.",
