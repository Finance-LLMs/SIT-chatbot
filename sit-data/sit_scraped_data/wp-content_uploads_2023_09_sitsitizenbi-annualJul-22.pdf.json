Due for\ncompletion in 2024, SIT’s new home in the Punggol Digital\nDistrict will be where the reimagining of higher education can\ntake place within a community setting. This issue features the\nfirst of a two-part series on SIT’s future campus, where we take\na closer look at two distinctive facilities, the Ho Bee Auditorium\nand the Chua Thian Poh Discovery Hub – both made possible\nby Dr Chua Thian Poh, the Founder and Executive Chairman of\nHo Bee Group.\nThis issue of SITizen also welcomes Mr Bill Chang, Chief\nExecutive Officer, Group Enterprise and Country Chief Officer\nSingapore of Singtel, who succeeded Mr Ng Yat Chung as\nChairman of SIT Board of Trustees with effect from 16 March\n2022.

SIT is embarking\non a four-year joint research programme with Agrocorp to\nunderstand how to sustainably produce plant-based food\nalternatives that are both nutritious and affordable. Together\nwith Enterprise SG and JTC, SIT has also jointly launched\nthe FoodPlant. The facility will contribute to Singapore’s\ntransformation as a food innovation hub by bolstering\nSingapore’s food innovation scene through small-batch\nproduction as well as Research and Development.\nIn the meantime, SITizens continue to stay connected through\nSIT Alumni Network events held over Zoom, and with the\neasing of safe management measures, they finally gathered\nfor Spin Class, the first physical SIT Network event after a long\nhiatus!

Chairman of Ho Bee Group,\nwith support from the Ministry\nof Education through Enhanced\nGovernment Matching Grants.\nSIT’s Ho Bee Auditorium — at\nPunggol and at Dover where SIT’s\ncurrent interim campus is located —\nwas named in 2019, thanks to\nendowed gifts totalling $3.25\nmillion from Ho Bee Land Limited\nthat also enabled SIT to establish in\nperpetuity the Ho Bee Scholarship\nto nurture academically promising\nundergraduate students from\nnine degree programmes\n(ranging from Engineering to\nInformation and Communications\nTechnology). These gifts from\nHo Bee Land Limited were the first\nto be received by SIT for its future\ncampus in Punggol.\nLess than three years later, in 2022,\nSIT named the Chua Thian Poh\nDiscovery Hub at Punggol (as well\nas the Chua Thian Poh Student\nActivities Centre at SIT@Dover\nin the interim, before its move to\nPunggol scheduled for 2024). The\nnamings were in recognition of a\nnew endowed gift of $2.6 million\nfrom the Chua Foundation, which\nhas also enabled SIT to make\navailable in perpetuity the\nChua Thian Poh Bursary for\nfinancially disadvantaged\nundergraduate students at SIT. The Chua Foundation was set up\nand funded by Dr Chua and his\nsiblings to continue the legacy of\ntheir late mother, Madam Seah\nSar, and to remember the values\nshe stood for. Madam Seah always\nemphasised the importance of\neducation, despite having little\neducation herself and was very\nkeen to help those in need.\nFollowing her example in nurturing\nthe next generation and aiding\nthe underprivileged, the\nChua Thian Poh Bursary seeks to\ngive SIT students the confidence to\nreach their true potential.\nIn both his private and public\ncapacities, Dr Chua’s support\nfor SIT and its students has been\ntransformative. His friendship with\nSIT began as far back in 2012,\nwhen he made possible the\nand community to collaborate\nand learn. Some 12,000 students\nto be nurtured in this living lab\nwill be able to find out about the\nlatest industry developments and\nknow-how, through participating in\ninterdisciplinary projects and the\ntest-bedding of smart technologies.\nEnvisioned as the Punggol Digital\nDistrict’s knowledge hub, the\nnew campus will be where SIT\nstaff and students – together\nwith the industry and community – work on new technologies and\ntheir applications to address the\nmost challenging issues, including\nclimate change and sustainability,\ndigitalisation, food security and\ncommunity healthcare.\nAmong the distinctive facilities\ngiving shape to this new educational\nlandscape are the Ho Bee Auditorium\nand the Chua Thian Poh Discovery\nHub. Both have been made possible\nat SIT by philanthropist Dr Chua\nThian Poh, the Founder and Executive SIT-Chua Thian Poh Scholarship in\nsupport of a student who needed\nurgent financial assistance.\nAt the naming ceremony for the Ho\nBee Auditorium, which was held\non 1 July 2019, Dr Chua, who was\nthen Chairman and CEO of Ho Bee\nLand, said: “As the University of\napplied learning in Singapore, the\napproach taken by SIT to develop\nfour distinctive qualities in their\nstudents resonates with Ho Bee.” He\nadded that “the graduates of SIT are\ngroomed to be ‘thinking tinkerers’.”\nHe also said: “They are encouraged\nnot to accept status quo but are\ndriven to become the ‘catalysts for\ntransformation’. More importantly,\nthey are often reminded to be\n“grounded in the community” to\nserve the general public.”\nHe added: “At Ho Bee, we are also\na believer of thinking out of the box\nand expanding the boundaries. We\nbelieve a good education helps\nopen doors to many opportunities. It\nhelps to nurture the next generation\nof leaders and professionals. We also\nhope that it will help impart to them\nthe good values of giving back to the\ncommunity.”\nWatch out for part 2 of this occasional\nseries on SIT’s future campus in the\nnext issue of SITizen Bi-Annual\nArtwork of Ho Bee Auditorium and\nChua Thian Poh Discovery Hub by\nSIT alumnus Ms Lau En Bei.CHUA THIAN POH\nDISCOVERY HUB\nHO BEE\nAUDITORIUM\n6 7\n6\nArtist’s impression of the Ho Bee Auditorium at SIT’s future campus in Punggol.

It will be located at Levels 3\nand 5 of Block E2 in the East Zone\nof SIT’s future Punggol Campus. Prof Chua Kee Chaing, President,\nSIT, expressed appreciation for\nDr Chua’s support at the naming\nceremony of the Chua Thian Poh\nDiscovery Hub held on 26 January\n2022: “On behalf of SIT, I wish to\nsay just how grateful we are for\nhis firm support and friendship all\nthese years. We would also like to\nthank him for his vote of confidence\nin SIT’s vision, and for taking the\nlead to support our future campus\nin Punggol — and SIT hopes to see\nmany more donors who will join\nDr Chua in shaping the future of\nour young university.”\nachieve”. He also expressed SIT’s\n“heartfelt appreciation” for\nDr Chua’s “philanthropic leadership\nin making possible this very first gift\nto support our future campus” and\nthanked him for “taking the lead to\nsupport SIT and our students at this\npoint of our journey, as our young\nuniversity leaps forward into its\nsecond decade”.

The answer is through exercise\nand housework, according to recent studies by\nAssoc Prof Wee Shiou Liang\nOver the last decade, Assoc\nProf Wee Shiou Liang has been\nworking with community partners\nto develop strategies and evaluate\ninterventions to extend the\nhealth span of older persons, and\nbetter enable ageing in place. An\nexample is working with health\ntechnology company, PulseSync\nto study the effectiveness of the\nGym Tonic (GT) pneumatic machine\nresistance training programme for\nolder persons.\nImpact of Gym Tonic: Helping\nOlder Persons Maintain Strength\nand Function\nGT was initiated by the Lien\nFoundation in 2014, and\nPulseSync undertook the task of\noperationalising GT at community\nclubs and senior care centres. A\nresearch team led by Assoc Prof\nWee evaluated the impact of GT\nusing a pragmatic, randomised-\ncontrolled trial design from 2018\nto 2019.\nFindings from the research were\npublished in the journal, European\nReview of Aging and Physical\nActivity. It found that seniors\nwho participated in the exercise programme twice a week, over the\ncourse of three months, showed\nimproved muscle strength and\ngait speed — demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the GT programme.\nAssoc Prof Wee said, “From\nmy other community-based\nresearch, multi-modal (physical\nand cognitive) functional training\nand activities can complement\nGT to achieve better functional\nperformance for older adults in\npower, balance, endurance, and\nmental tasks relevant to maintaining\nan independent lifestyle.\nBreakthroughs on Ageing\nResearch\nResearch on ageing, health\nand social services, and care\nintegration must be multi-\nand trans-disciplinary with quick\nreal-world industry and community\napplications and translations.\nAssoc Prof Wee feels that SIT’s\nestablished networks with industry\nand community facilitate the\nsharing of resources and multi-level\ncollaborations required to advance\nand translate ageing research.\n“Not only does SIT HSS work closely\nwith allied health, nursing, social\nsciences, we also collaborate with\nother SIT academic clusters. We\nplace strong emphasis on applied\nlearning and research, making us\nwell-placed to connect resources\nand advance research for heathy\nageing,” he said. In addition, he\nbelieves such collaborations are key\nto accelerating research translation.\nAmong other research areas that\nAssoc Prof Wee looks into is how\nhousework is associated with higher\ncognitive function, specifically in\nattention and memory, among older\nadults. This research was published\nin November 2021 in BMJ Open.\nSingapore’s Approach to Ageing\nand Long-term Care\nThese research areas support\nSingapore’s focus with regards to\nageing: extending health span;\nageing in place; and advancing\ncare model - relevant to people\nliving with chronic health problems\nthat affect their ability to perform\neveryday activities. Long term\ncare in Singapore is currently undergoing rapid transformation in\ncapacity, capability, and care model\ndevelopments.\nThe World Health Organisation\nnow defines healthy ageing as\n‘a process of developing and\nmaintaining the functional ability\nthat enables well-being in older\nage’. This approach points towards\noptimising capacity together\nwith cultivating an empowering\nenvironment for ageing in place.\nTherefore, nursing homes in\nSingapore need to evolve from\nfunctioning primarily as medical\ninstitutions to residential homes.\n29Caring for Nursing Home\nResidents\nA large proportion of nursing\nhome residents are persons\nwith dementia. Assoc Prof Wee\nemphasised that we can view\ndementia as a shift in the way\nan individual experiences the\nenvironment. “Functional decline\njust means one’s life is not what it\nused to be, so one must gradually\naccept a ‘new normal’,” he said.\nThis article first appeared in SIT’s\nDigital Newsroom.\n28Assoc Prof Wee has been working with\ncommunity partners to develop strategies\nand evaluate interventions to extend the\nhealth span of older persons and better\nenable ageing in place over the last decade.\n30 31\nThe Promise of VR for\nPatient Rehabilitation\nSIT’s Virtual Reality (VR) Mobility Training project aims to\nexplore ways in which VR can help patients with mobility\nconstraints relive meaningful daily experiences\nA forward-thinking project by\nAssoc Prof Benjamin Soon, Health\nand Social Sciences, SIT, aims to\ncombine VR technology and an\nomni-directional platform to improve\nrehabilitation efforts for patients\nwith Parkinson’s disease, stroke as\nwell as impairments facing mobility\nconstraints, by allowing them to\nrelive meaningful daily experiences,\nsuch as grocery shopping in a\nsupermarket, in a safe and pleasant\nvirtual space.The SIT team spearheading the development of the Virtual Reality Mobility Training include\n(from left) Assoc Prof Benjamin Soon, Health and Social Sciences; alumnus Mr Lim Zhiliang,\nMechanical Engineering; and Assoc Prof Alfred Tan, Engineering.\nThe omni-directional VR treadmill,\nalso known as the Kat Walk\nsystem, provides a platform for\nthe user to walk on while waist-\nstrapped for safety. In addition,\nusers can rely on handlebars for\nsupport instead of roaming freely\naround in a room.\nDifferent from traditional\nrehabilitation methods where\npatients are expected to walk or\nrun on a conventional treadmill,\nthe Virtual Reality Mobility Training (VRMT)’s treadmill platform allows\nthe user to decide whether to walk,\nrun, sit or even squat.\nThe VR element allows users to\nimmerse themselves in a virtual\nenvironment familiar to them.\nThe system comes with 360˚\npre-recorded videos of real-life\nsurroundings that simulate a\nrealistic environment. Using the VR\ngoggles, users will be able to see\nscenes of a recorded environment\nthat move, according to their\nwalking pace.\n“The system will help train the\nmuscles used in walking and\nstanding balance. The VR element\nmay even get users to go out and\nmotivate them to use the system\nrather than lie in bed,” said Assoc\nProf Soon.\nThe Virtual Reality Mobility Training\n(VRMT) is a collaboration between\nfaculty and students from SIT’s\nPhysiotherapy and Mechanical\nEngineering programmes; the\nInfocomm Technology cluster; the\nuniversity’s Professional Officers;\nand physiotherapists from Ng Teng\nFong General Hospital (NTFGH).\nDr Cai Cong Cong, Senior\nPrincipal Physiotherapist from\nthe Rehabilitation Department of\nNTFGH, added that the device\nrepresents a new treatment\napproach that could potentially\nimprove rehabilitation efficiencies\nand patient uptake. “The\ngamification features may pique\npatients’ curiosity and interest them\nto try the device,” he said.\nTo date, the VRMT prototype\nhas been tested on a total of 35\nindividuals, of whom eight are\nprofessional physiotherapists.\nThis article first appeared in SIT’s\nDigital Newsroom.\n31Bespoke Hip Protector Enhances\nSafety of Fall-prone Seniors\nDeveloped by SIT and G4 Pte Ltd, the lightweight and\nbreathable EXO+ hip protector offers protection for Ren\nCi Hospital’s nursing home residents\nSIT and G4 Pte Ltd have\ncollaborated with Ren Ci Hospital to\ndevelop a customised hip protector\nthat offers good protection and\ncomfort for fall-prone seniors. Ren\nCi Hospital is the first facility in the\ncommunity care sector to trial the\nEXO+, a lightweight hip protector\nmade with breathable material for\nSingapore’s hot and humid climate.\nThe patented hip protector features\na foam pad made of sandwiched\nlayers of impact-absorbing foam\nand elastomers to cushion the\nwearer’s hip in the event of a fall.\nFollowing positive feedback from\nresidents, Ren Ci Hospital will be\ndeploying the hip protector at\nboth its nursing homes to selected\nresidents with fall-risk potential due\nto gait or lower limb weakness.\n“We expect hip fractures among\nseniors to be on the rise as the\npopulation ages. While there\nare existing hip protectors in the\nmarket, most are not easy to put on.\nThey also trap heat when worn for\nlong hours and cause discomfort for\nthe elderly. Compliance becomes a\nreal issue. In comparison, EXO+ is\neasy to wear, more breathable, and\nsuitable for our local climate – all the\nbenefits that aid initial acceptance\nby our elderly residents. This\nremoves problems with compliance,\nso our seniors, especially those with\nosteoporosis, can avoid potentially\nlife-threatening hip fractures,” said\nMs Tan Tzuu Ling, Assistant Director,\nNursing at Ren Ci Hospital.Donning the EXO+ hip protector has given\nMr Mohamed Hafidz bin Samat, 59 (left),\nadded confidence to walk more and rely\nless on his wheelchair. Photo courtesy of\nRen Ci Hospital.The team from SIT and G4 (which\nspecialises in protective gear for\ndefence and healthcare) drew\ninspiration from the exoskeleton\nstructure of crustaceans for the\ndesign of the hip pads. The EXO+\nuses flexible elastomers made of a\nstretchable material that can return\nto its original structure after the\nrelease of impact — meaning it has\nself-repairing properties unless the\nimpact causes a permanent fracture\nof the materials.\n“Based on the impact test result, a\npeak force reduction of up to 20.4%\non the femur can be achieved if\nthe EXO+ is worn in the intended\nposition in the event of a fall,”\nsaid Assoc Prof Soh Chew Beng,\nProgramme Leader, Sustainable\nInfrastructure Engineering (Building\nServices), SIT. “The results show\nthat the EXO+ is more effective\nat reducing impact forces on the\nfemur during a fall, hence reducing the likelihood of a hip fracture.”\nResearch on the hip protector was\nfunded under the Translational\nR&D and Innovation Fund (TIF)\nadministered by Singapore’s\nMinistry of Education. TIF supports\napplied research and translational\nprojects, which can be developed\nin partnership with industry to\nenable new innovations, products,\nand services. The effectiveness\nof the impact absorbance of the\nhip pads has been validated by\nCardiff University, with mechanical\ntesting conducted according to\nthe Canadian Standard Association\n7325:20 for hip protectors for a\nsimulated fall.\n“We now have a better solution at\nhand. However, ensuring that the\nelderly understand and comply\nwith wearing the hip protector at\nall times is still key. From the initial\ntrial, we note that the hip protector\ncan also enhance the elderly’s\nconfidence to walk about within the\nhousehold independently. This will\nalso go a long way in ensuring that\nour elderly can remain ambulant for\nas long as possible,” said Ms Tan.Assoc Prof Soh Chew Beng (right),\nProgramme Leader, Sustainable Infrastructure\nEngineering (Building Services), SIT and Mr\nSamuel Lim, former Research Engineer at\nSIT, displaying the hip protector belts in the\ncharacterisation lab at SIT@Dover, where they\nperformed material characterisation.\nThis article first appeared in SIT’s\nDigital Newsroom.\n32 33\nMixed Reality App by\nSIT Faculty Debuts at\nSingapore Airshow 2022\nInterdisciplinary team comprising SIT faculty and industry partners HOPE\nTechnik and HelloHolo debuts a mixed reality application for design\nengineering and finite element analysis at Singapore Airshow 2022\nEngineers who create and assemble\nlarge, heavy prototypes on the\nworkshop floor are faced with work\nthat is not only time-consuming\nbut dangerous. This sparked an\nidea for Asst Prof Kyrin Jo Liong\n— what if design engineers could\nuse holographic prototypes to\noptimise designs before any physical\nprototyping and assembly took\nplace? Aside from being faster and\nsafer, it would also be more cost\neffective.\nAssembling an\nInterdisciplinary Team\nAssoc Prof Jeannie Lee, Deputy\nDirector of SIT’s Centre for\nImmersification, led the overall\ndevelopment and software framework\nfor the mixed reality (MR) application\nas well as the research investigation\non the best user interface methods.\nShe emphasised the importance\nof having an interdisciplinary team.\n“The combination of knowledge and\nexpertise from different domains\nallows for different perspectives and\ncreative solutions and applications,”\nshe said.\nIn addition to faculty staff from the\nEngineering and ICT academic\nclusters, Integrative Team Project\n(ITP) student teams as well as a bevy\nof student assistants from SIT also\ncontributed.

Using the MR\napplication, engineers could load\ndigital models and test the feasibility\nof the assembly process of the OL\ndeployed via a Microsoft HoloLens\n2, a mixed reality headset. Design\nengineers would be able to safely\nnavigate assembly issues prior to\nhandling the physical prototypes.\nthen start building the physical\nprototype once it reached a more\nstable stage.Potential Real-world Applications\nAny industry that requires design\nengineering will be able to benefit\nfrom the MR application, which\ncan be customised and refined\nto further integrate with the laws\nof physics for realistic real-world\nresponse. Instead of simply fitting\npieces together, it can be used to\ntest the weight-bearing properties\nof structures or identify stress\npoints in the various components,\nthereby enhancing accuracy and\nthe safety of the users.\n“The application can provide\nvisualisation and training in\ndifferent engineering domains\nthat require structured steps for\nperforming a task. In the future, we\ncould include remote collaboration\nand training features to further\nimprove training and knowledge\ntransfer,” said Assoc Prof Lee.\nFrom left: Mr Tan Kian Ann, Business Development Manager, HelloHolo, Asst Prof Kyrin Liong,\nSIT, Mr Emran Poh, Research Engineer, SIT.

The team started work in\nOctober 2019 and the project will\nbe finalised in July 2022.\nThe team from HOPE Technik said,\n“Working on this grant with SIT\nwas a pleasure. It was organised,\nwell-paced, and the team delivered\naccording to plan.”\nMr Kee Cheng Heng, Managing\nDirector of HelloHolo added, “The\npartnership between SIT and HOPE\nhas created a platform that allows\nus to explore how immersive media\ntechnologies can be applied in new\nand innovative ways. The research\ndone on Finite Element Analysis\n(FEA), together with the ability of\nHoloLens 2 to visualise point cloud\ndata, allows us to revolutionise and\nstreamline the way engineering and\nmanufacturing can be conducted.”\n33Assoc Prof Alfred Tan also\nelaborated on the potential\nuse of the MR application as an\neducational tool. He said, “It will\nbenefit students who need extra\nhelp in visualising how components\ncome together. The tricky part\nis how to devise a way to allow\nimages seen by the user to be\nviewed by a larger audience group\nsimultaneously.”\nThe challenge is creating a\nsteady image that can be viewed\ncomfortably by an audience.\nCurrently, the visualisations\nproduced via the Hololens while\nthe user is moving around can be\ndisorienting when viewed by an\nexternal party, and even cause\nmotion sickness. A potential\nsolution is to create a suitable\ntracking rail or slider for a camera\nthat can capture multiple angles.\nThis article first appeared in SIT’s\nDigital Newsroom.\n34 35\nSITizen’s Space Illustrations\nDraw NASA’s Attention\nNASA sending Digital Communications & Integrated Media (DCIM) student Mr Jarrod Chua a\ndirect message on Instagram is the start of great things to come\nIt was the height of the circuit\nbreaker in 2020 and Mr Jarrod\nChua, serving his National Service,\nwas eager to get his creative juices\nflowing for a craft that he loves\n– graphic design. While musing\nhis passions, an idea suddenly\nstruck him – why not combine his\ndeep-rooted fascination in space\nwith his graphic design skills?\nFrom Fairytale to\nspaceytales\nAs a young boy, Mr Chua was\nintrigued by space but did not\nknow how to put his interest into\npractice because science was not\nhis strong subject. He eventually\ndecided to make use of graphic\ndesign skills that he had picked\nup at Singapore Polytechnic. “I\nthought maybe I can create a Mr Jarrod Chua is a Year 1 Digital Communications and Integrated Media (DCIM) student at SIT.

The account attracted\n1,000 followers within a month and\n8,655 followers by end 2021.\nFamed space institution\nNational Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) contacted\nhim later, saying they were\nimpressed with his work. Mr Chua’s\ndesign was used for the launch of\nthe James Webb Space Telescope\nin December 2021, the largest and\nmost expensive telescope ever\nplaced in space. It is worth US$9\nbillion (approximately\nS$12.5 billion).\nDesigned by Mr Chua, the SpaceyTales\n“#UnfoldTheUniverse” James Webb\nSpace Telescope Postcard is available\nfor download on NASA’s website\n(https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/\nfeatures/postcards.html)\ncomic about space.

Swapping out the “fairy”\nwith “space”, he put together\n“spaceytales”!Screenshot of a post from Jarrod’s spaceytales Instagram account.He stresses that his collaboration\nwith NASA wouldn’t have\nsucceeded without SIT, saying\nthat the university has helped him\ncultivate his skills in photography,\nstoryboarding, animation, and\nadvertising, and given him the\nability to grow spaceytales into\na bigger art brand. “When I was\nlearning the Digital Advertising\nBranding Campaigning module,\nwe were at the execution phase of\nthe project and my lecturer helped\nme to better understand the\ndifferent media aspects involved in\nadvertising,” he said.\nMr Chua now hopes to one day\nwork for NASA in the public\noutreach or design department\nand share more knowledge about\nspace. “While I can’t personally\ncontribute much in the physics or astrophysics department of space, I\nhope to inspire the next generation\nto look up to the skies and work\nto become the future astronaut\nor physicist so that we can make\nprogress within the space industry.”\nMs Angela Ng Shueh Ching, Senior\nLecturer, DCIM, believes he has\nroom to unlock his full potential.\n“Now is the time for Jarrod to\nbuild a portfolio that will attract\nthe interest of international clients.\nJarrod is imaginative and I see him\npushing his creative boundaries.\nThere is room for personal growth\nin terms of skill sets and exposures,\nand he has the potential to grow\ninto a great graphic designer as\nlong as he keeps harnessing his\nimagination,” said Ms Ng.\nThis article first appeared in SIT’s\nDigital Newsroom.\n36 37\nHacker Turns Award-Winning\nCybersecurity Defender\nAlumnus and Cybersecurity aficionado Mr Yu Pengfei, winner of the Student Award at\nthe Association of Information Security Professionals (AiSP) Cybersecurity Awards 2021,\nencourages an open and inclusive cybersecurity community through the N0H4TS movement\nMr Yu Pengfei (left) accepts the Student Award at the prestigious AiSP Cybersecurity Awards 2021, presented by Mrs Josephine Teo (right),\nMinister for Communications and Information & Second Minister for Home Affairs, on 14 January 2022. He is now a Cybersecurity Specialist\nwith GovTech.\nFrom Offence to Defence\nMr Yu Pengfei first attempted to\nhack into games after picking up\nbasic programming knowledge\nin his teenage years.\nWhile playing online role-\nplaying game Perfect World,\nhe succeeded. “I realised all\nthe information was stored on\nmy computer, and not on the\ngame’s server,” he said. So he\ncheekily raised the powers of his\ncharacter, disrupted the game’s\nserver and even took much joy\nin ‘killing’ off other players. His\nbreakthrough was somewhat\naccidental — he did not quite\nunderstand how he managed\nto infiltrate.Multiple award winner Mr Yu Pengfei, who found his passion in upholding cybersecurity, took\npart in various competitions to pit his skills in both local and international arena.\nSuch training was further enhanced\nduring his Integrated Work Study\nProgramme (IWSP) with GovTech\nSingapore, when he was tasked to\ndevelop an application capable\nof detecting code vulnerability.\nEventually, it landed him a job as\na Cybersecurity Specialist with\nGovTech.\nThe N0H4TS Movement\nHis work with N0H4TS has\ngarnered him the most attention.\nTogether with three friends, they\nset up a club to provide support in\nthe cybersecurity field — a support\nwhich extends beyond campuses.\n“It was quite difficult to find a group\nwhere I could come in and talk to\npeople about certain aspects of\ncybersecurity that interest us. So\nthat’s what made us start it,” said\nthe 25-year-old SIT alumnus.\nN0H4TS is about constantly\nlearning and exploring. Its logo\nsays ‘You Know Nothing’, telling\nits members to start from a fresh\nslate, before deciding what hat to\nwear. “Always be open to learn new\nstuff and relearn what you’ve been\ntaught,” he added.\nNow, the movement is a non-profit\norganisation that hosts multiple\ncybersecurity events and online\nCapture the Flag leagues that\ngarner over 300 participants from\nvarious institutes of higher learning\nin Singapore.\nIt is followed by an annual Cyber\nLeague Playoff between the top eight teams that performed best\nonline that year. These efforts led\nAsst Prof Goh to nominate him for\nthe AiSP Cybersecurity Awards.\n“Pengfei’s achievements in\nnumerous local and international\ncompetitions can simply be\ndescribed as outstanding.  I can\nInstitutes of higher learning,\nand in particular the Singapore\nInstitute of Technology (SIT), would\nhelp him figure it out. Mr Yu later\nenrolled into SIT’s Information\nand Communications Technology\n(Information Security) degree\nprogramme to deepen and\nsharpen his cyber defence skills,\nwhich would eventually turn him\nfrom an offender into a defender.\nLearning Through Playing\nThe practical, even fun, way\nin which SIT approached\ncybersecurity dovetailed perfectly\nwith the active and playful young\nman.

In return, I now dedicate my\nlife back to helping others in the\ncommunity,” said Mr Loo, who is\nalso volunteering at a soup kitchen\nand for a sustainability community\nproject involving upcycling food\nwastage.\nBoth Mr Tey and Mr Loo are SITizen\nAmbassadors, a group of student\nleaders who exemplify the SIT-DNA.\nThey serve as strong advocates of\nSIT to their peers and members of\nthe public by sharing about the SIT\nexperience.
