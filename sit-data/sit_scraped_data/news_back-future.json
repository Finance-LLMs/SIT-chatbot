    "Back to the future",
    "When Prof Toh laid out his vision for the future of the automobile to an auditorium packed with fellow professors and students, he also challenged the audience to brace themselves for some of the wide-sweeping changes which would reshape society.",
    "Prof Toh, who currently lectures on Digital Design and Programming at",
    "SIT",
    ", was delivering his presentation as part of a series of talks on engineering and its transformative power at the fifth National Engineers Day (NED). Held at",
    "NUS University Town",
    "on 18 and 19 July, the event comprised seminars on an array of issues ranging from aerospace to additive manufacturing to entrepreneurship.",
    "In his presentation titled ‘Future Cars – Impact of Telematics & Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Technologies’, Prof Toh, who will head a new SIT degree programme later this year, highlighted some of the key technologies in the car of the future.",
    "The future car would possess the capability to ‘talk’ and communicate with other cars using wireless communication. Prof Toh went on to cite the examples of such automobiles, including a futuristic ambulance which would be capable of transmitting alarms to other vehicles via wireless signals instead of conventional sirens when clearing traffic.",
    "The automobile of the future would also be equipped with a ‘Collision Avoidance System’ with automatic braking features to minimise potential collision impact. In addition, the future car would be able to self-park. Vehicle manufacturer Nissan, the professor revealed, is already planning to roll out such cars by 2016.",
    "Car design and function would further push boundaries as the gap between imagination and reality narrows. Vehicles in the future, for instance, would be able to take flight, said Prof Toh, who cited the example of Volkswagen’s levitating car which is currently in development. They would also be able to ‘self-drive’ as cars and roads make the final transition to becoming ‘intelligent’.",
    "Ultimately, the best way to predict the future was to create the future, argued Prof Toh. His conviction was aptly encapsulated in his own words: “The future is what we have imagined.”",

Held at\nNUS University Town\non 18 and 19 July, the event comprised seminars on an array of issues ranging from aerospace to additive manufacturing to entrepreneurship.\nIn his presentation titled ‘Future Cars – Impact of Telematics & Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Technologies’, Prof Toh, who will head a new SIT degree programme later this year, highlighted some of the key technologies in the car of the future.\nThe future car would possess the capability to ‘talk’ and communicate with other cars using wireless communication. Prof Toh went on to cite the examples of such automobiles, including a futuristic ambulance which would be capable of transmitting alarms to other vehicles via wireless signals instead of conventional sirens when clearing traffic.\nThe automobile of the future would also be equipped with a ‘Collision Avoidance System’ with automatic braking features to minimise potential collision impact. In addition, the future car would be able to self-park. Vehicle manufacturer Nissan, the professor revealed, is already planning to roll out such cars by 2016.\nCar design and function would further push boundaries as the gap between imagination and reality narrows. Vehicles in the future, for instance, would be able to take flight, said Prof Toh, who cited the example of Volkswagen’s levitating car which is currently in development. They would also be able to ‘self-drive’ as cars and roads make the final transition to becoming ‘intelligent’.\nUltimately, the best way to predict the future was to create the future, argued Prof Toh. His conviction was aptly encapsulated in his own words: “The future is what we have imagined.”\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nThe fruits of experimentation\nview\nNext\nSIT Signs Landmark MOUs with Accounting Industry Leaders\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
