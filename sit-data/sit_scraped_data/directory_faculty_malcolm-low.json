    "description": "Dr. Malcolm Yoke Hean Low is currently an Associate Professor with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), and a member of the SIT Systems Section (S3). Prior to joining SIT, he was the Vice President (Aerospace) with D-SIMLAB Technologies. In 2006, Malcolm joined the Nanyang Technological University as an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Engineering where he led large-scale simulation and optimization research projects in the defence and maritime domains funded by the Singapore Ministry of Defence and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. Prior to this, he was with the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology where he executed simulation-based optimization projects with multinational companies. He received his Bachelor and Master of Applied Science in Computer Engineering from Nanyang Technological University. He was awarded a Gintic (now SIMTech) Postgraduate Scholarship in 1999 to pursue a doctorate degree in UK. In 2002, he received his D.Phil. degree in Computer Science from the Oxford University. In 2004, he was awarded the APEC Korea Post-doctoral Fellowship in Science and Engineering as a Visiting Research Fellow with the Department of Industrial Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Engineering (KAIST). He was a co-investigator for the area of symbiotic simulation in the A*STAR funded pilot project “An Integrated and Adaptive Simulation-Based Decision-Support Framework for High Tech Manufacturing and Service Networks”. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and ACM, and was the principal investigator of a Singapore Ministry of Defence funded project on “Evolutionary Computing Methodologies for Modelling, Simulation and Analysis” under the Defence Innovation Research Programme, as well as the principal investigator in the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and APL funded research project on “Optimization of Stowage Plans for Large Containerships”. He has extensive experience in modelling and simulation, planning and scheduling, as well as parallel computing. His current research interest is in the application of parallel/distributed simulation, grid computing and agent technology for the modelling, simulation, analysis and optimization of complex systems.",

    "Oxford University",
    ".",
    "In 2004, he was awarded the APEC Korea Post-doctoral Fellowship in Science and Engineering as a Visiting Research Fellow with the Department of Industrial Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Engineering (KAIST). He was a co-investigator for the area of symbiotic simulation in the A*STAR funded pilot project “An Integrated and Adaptive Simulation-Based Decision-Support Framework for High Tech Manufacturing and Service Networks”.",
    "He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and ACM, and was the principal investigator of a Singapore Ministry of Defence funded project on “Evolutionary Computing Methodologies for Modelling, Simulation and Analysis” under the Defence Innovation Research Programme, as well as the principal investigator in the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and APL funded research project on “Optimization of Stowage Plans for Large Containerships”. He has extensive experience in modelling and simulation, planning and scheduling, as well as parallel computing. His current research interest is in the application of parallel/distributed simulation, grid computing and agent technology for the modelling, simulation, analysis and optimization of complex systems.",
