    "The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering [via the Competency-based Stackable Micro-credential (CSM) Pathway] is a four-year direct honours programme offered by SIT. This programme is designed to provide an upgrading pathway for in-employment individuals.",
    "The programme will equip learners with robust technical expertise in electrical and electronic engineering, essential for addressing complex engineering challenges in our digitally interconnected world.",
    "Learners will acquire competencies in areas such as data analytics, operational excellence, sustainable energy systems, and semiconductor manufacturing, empowering them to design and develop systems, devices, and technologies pivotal to our daily lives.",
    "This new CSM pathway comprises six components: engineering experience modules, university-level requirements and engineering ethics component, micro-credentials, unrestricted electives, a workforce essentials component, and a capstone project.",
    "Each micro-credential is designed to be self-contained and vertically integrated, allowing learners to master a block of competencies through real-life engineering applications and innovation projects.",
    "To minimise disruption to the learner’s work, the micro-credentials will be delivered via a combination of asynchronous and synchronous modes. Selected practical sessions, laboratory sessions, and assessments will be conducted face-to-face. This will provide learners with the flexibility to personalise their learning journey as needed for work and personal aspirations, while managing multiple commitments.",
    "Upon completion of each micro-credential, learners will be awarded a Specialist Certificate.",
    "Competency-based Education",
    "This programme is predominantly delivered through a competency-based education (CBE) approach where learners acquire and demonstrate mastery of knowledge and skills that are directly relevant to job functions. Each learner will be provided with a personalised academic experience, giving them the flexibility to progress at their own pace.",
    "With the support of dedicated instructors and the use of learning analytics, learners will be guided to the desired level of competency mastery. This prepares them to be industry-ready and allows them to apply their newly acquired competencies to their work.",
    "Recognition of Prior Learning",
    "In addition, this programme recognises a learner’s prior learning, such as industry certifications or competencies acquired from work. This allows learners to be given credit or exemptions for knowledge and skills they have previously acquired, further personalising the learning experience for them.",
    "Coaching for Success",
    "To enhance learning in the programme, a team of qualified success coaches, alongside SIT instructors, will provide dedicated support to learners throughout their learning journey. These success coaches work closely with each learner to develop personalised academic goal-setting plans tailored to their individual needs.",
    "Through the success coaches, learners will gain access to a wide range of resources and additional support services, empowering them with the necessary tools to navigate their academic journey successfully. The success coaches also partner with programme instructors to monitor and pace learners, providing encouragement and celebrating with learners as they journey through different milestones.",
    "Programme Components",
    "Engineering Experience Modules (50 credits)",
    "A set of foundational modules that teaches learners practical engineering skills. Learners will be engaged in interactive, hands-on learning, problem-solving, and critical thinking.",
    "University-Level Requirements and Engineering Ethics (18 credits)",
    "Opportunities to gain transferable skills such as communication and design thinking, as well as concepts and practices of engineering ethics, which are critical to the engineering profession.",
    "Micro-credentials (18 credits each)",
    "Two (2) Engineering micro-credentials covering data analytics and operational excellence",
    "Two (2) Programme micro-credentials covering the necessary fundamental knowledge and skills in the discipline of electrical and electronic engineering.",
    "Two (2) Programme Elective micro-credentials providing specific knowledge and skills for targeted industries such as semiconductor technology and electronics manufacturing.",
    "Unrestricted Electives (18 credits)",
    "Unrestricted Electives allow learners to choose either a micro-credential or a set of modules from any cluster to broaden their learning.",
    "Workforce Essentials (30 credits)",
    "Career Catalyst – Opportunities to acquire competencies in effective communication, career development, and agile learning. Learners may be allowed to gain credit recognition if they possess and demonstrate the competencies in this competency unit.",
    "Relevant Industry Work Experience – Opportunities to demonstrate readiness in the industry at the workplace. Learners with relevant work experience may be allowed to gain credit recognition for this competency unit.",
    "Capstone Project (16 credits)",
    "Major integrative element of undergraduate learning to demonstrate capability in solving an industry-relevant complex engineering problem.",
    "Total of 240 credits. Each micro-credential takes one trimester (three-plus months) to complete.",
    "Recommended Learning Pathway",
    "To graduate within four years, learners will need to complete one micro-credential or elective each trimester. Learners with relevant work experience may seek recognition of prior learning during the application process. Learners with a relevant polytechnic diploma may be exempted from the Engineering Experience Modules and enter directly into Year 2 of the programme.",
    "Learners who enter Year 1 will complete 30 credits of Workforce Essentials carried out over four trimesters, while learners who enter Year 2 will complete 20 credits of Workforce Essentials carried out over two trimesters.",
    "In-employment learners can embark on a capstone project upon completing at least five micro-credentials.",
    "The following illustrates a suggested learning pathway to graduate in less than four years:",
    "Learners who desire more flexibility in balancing work and studies have up to six years to complete the degree.",
    "Specialisation in Semiconductor Manufacturing",
    "Learners may choose to graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering with Specialisation in Semiconductor Manufacturing. To qualify for the specialisation, learners must complete the following two micro-credentials:",
    "Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology",
    "Robotics and Automation",
    "These two micro-credentials will provide learners with the required competencies associated with semiconductor manufacturing, enabling them to implement automation technologies for enhanced productivity in the semiconductor industry.",
