Therefore, financial\ninclusion is an issue that needs to be ad-\ndressed,” she said.\nSUTD’s Tanargues that the point isn’t\nwhetherthesegmentshouldorshouldnotbe\ngiven credit, but rather if credit is commensu-\nrate with the customers’ creditworthiness.\nHere, digital banks could help with their\ntech tools. “For instance, they can use data\nanalytics to better monitor the credit usage\npatterns to identify potential customers who\nare showing signs of irresponsible credit us-\nage, or design their app interfaces in away\nthat presents credit-related information in\neasy-to-understand ways,” he said.\nNeutrali tyofcredit\nAsatool, credit is neither good nor bad, says\nTanHuey Min, general manager at Credit\nCounseling Singapore (CCS).\n“It has its function to allow us to buy and\nenjoy the item before we have the full sum of\nmoney to purchase it,” said Tan.\nThere are guidelines governing some of the\nmore easily available products. Unsecured\ncredit cards have an annual salary require-\nment of S$30,000, and financial institutions\ncan only allow customers to owe 12times their\nmonthly salary in unsecured credit. This limit\nhas come down since 20 15when it was 24\ntimes.\nIt is careless use of credit ending up in un-\npaid debt that lands consumers in trouble.\nThe numbers from CCS show an increasing\npercentage of under-30-year-olds seeking\nhelp over the years, from 11.9 pe rcent of cli-\nents in 20 19to16.3 per cent in 2022. But in\nabsolute numbers, the numbe rofclients un-\nder 30 years old has actually fallen, from 388\nin 20 19to 257 in 2022.\nResponsible use of credit does help in the\nlong run by building up aperson’s credit histo-\nry,a sd atacoupled with models can predict to\nahighdegree of certainty whether aperson is\nagood or bad borrower.\nWhile the amount of credit from BNPL\nplayers increased about four times, from\nS$114million to S$440 million from 202 1t o\n2022, SIT’s Jutasompakorn notes that BNPL is\nonly adrop in the ocean.\n“BNPL remains asmall part of consumer un-\nsecured loans,” she said. “BNPL quantum in\n2021was only 1per cent of credi tcard and\ndebit card payments, and in 2022, i twas 0.5\nper cent.”\nThere are some who have eschewed credit\nfor debi tcards, such as Jane P.Hearing horror\nstories of others landing in debt has made the\n31-year-old avoid credit cards.\n“Not having access to acreditcard also\nmakes me consciously save towards my goals\nand question if Ireallyneed that purchase, trip\nor subscription …I’ma‘late bloomer’ to fi-\nnance, stil llearning abou thowIcan make my\nmoney work for me,” she said.\nStartin gyoung\nLearning how to budget and deal with credit\nare not subjects or topics that are normally\ntaught i nschools.

These can change generational per-\nceptions towards debt, says SUTD’s Tan.\nSIT’s Jutasompakorn believes that ahands-\non course –sucha sa simulation game at the\nuniversity level focused on risky credit beha-\nviour –can be effective, as well as acourse fo-\ncusing on topics such as time value of money/\ncompounded interest, budgeting, and debit/\ncredit card management.\nTanaddsthat the younger generation may\nbe viewing credit as atool to enhance their lif-\nestyle rather than afinancial obligation that\nneeds to be settled eventually ,s oa nuanced\napproach may be needed.\nLate payments on unsecured credit cards are on the rise in the 21-29 year old demographic ,shows\ndata from Credit Bureau Singapore.
