    "The university's health and social sciences faculty strength has grown in strength from fewer than three to today’s more than 70 members with wide-ranging expertise that includes various allied health specialties and basic sciences.",
    "SIT became Singapore’s 5th autonomous public university in 2014. In 2016, we launched the inaugural pre-registration allied health programmes of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, diagnostic radiography, and radiation therapy. The launch marked the momentous beginning of the dedicated training and grooming of Singapore’s own allied health professionals. Since then, HSS has rapidly grown from strength to strength. The addition of new undergraduate programmes Dietetics and Nutrition in 2019 and Speech and Language Therapy in 2020 serve the rising demand for holistic care and care services in Singapore. With the evolving healthcare climate and an ageing population, SIT-HSS is well-placed to nurture a reservoir of talents and professionals who will form a vital pillar to support Singapore’s healthcare system.",
    "The teaching faculty of the undergraduate programmes in HSS has expanded to more than 70 members whose expertise includes allied health specialties and basic sciences. In addition to being experienced and passionate educators, many HSS faculty members are established researchers and thought leaders who push the frontiers of knowledge and champion evidence-based clinical practice and education.",
