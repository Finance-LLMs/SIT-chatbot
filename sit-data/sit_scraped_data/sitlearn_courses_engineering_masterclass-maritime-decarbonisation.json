    "Decarbonisation has become a key agenda item for the maritime industry. The International Maritime Organisation aims to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least half by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. The goal is to eventually eliminate GHG emissions from shipping in this century.",
    "To achieve this goal, more ships will be equipped with various energy-efficient technologies and energy storage systems and be ready for alternative green fuels. This course will help engineers from shipyards and equipment/service providers renew their knowledge and engineering skills on the latest decarbonisation technologies. This course will also equip ship operators and middle managers, including ship owners and charterers, with knowledge of the latest green technologies, which will aid in their decision-making process.",
    "The course is designed to equip the participants with the basic operating principles and practical skills of the latest technologies, including ship digital twin, wind-assisted propulsion, air lubrication systems, carbon-neutral fuel, battery and shore-to-ship charging, shipboard carbon capture, and storage.",
    "Upon the completion of the course, participants will be able to:",
    "Understand the basic principles of the latest decarbonisation technologies",
    "Understand the advantages and limitations of each technology",
