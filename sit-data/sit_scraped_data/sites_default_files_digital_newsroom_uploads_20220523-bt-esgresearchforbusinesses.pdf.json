(W ewanted) to bring together\nagroup wi th no vested interests\nwho can evaluate published re-\nsearch objectively.”\nThe projec tcame about when\nthe chief executive officer (CEO) of\nSustainable Finance Institute Asia\n(SFIA), Eugene Wong,reached out –\nhis genuine passion to make adif-\nference in the area of sustainable fi-\nnance appealing to Prof Mak.\nWongsaid that he was much in-\nfluenced by ‘The Limits to Growth’\n–a1972 report on the exponential\neconomic and population growth\nwith afinite supply of resources –\nwhich he read while in university.\n“I was greatly struck by how the\nreckless use of resources, environ-\nmental abuse and social inequali-\nties would eventuall ylead to catas-\ntrophe, and that we desperately\nneeded to address this very real\npossibility.”\nRecognisin gthe wealth of aca-\ndemic intellectual capital out there\nthat has not been translated for use\nin practice ,particularly in the fi-\nnancial sector ,Wong felt the need\nto bring together agroup of aca-\ndemics, like Prof Mak, “who under-stands how the markets work and\ncould distil the high impact drivers\nfrom the academic research pool,\nand translate them for the market\ninaway that can catalyse action”.\nSeparately ,CPAAustralia (CP AA)\napproached the professor on col-\nlaborating on thought leadership\npublications in ESG. Given his long\nhistory of working with them,\nwhich includes producing 10vol-\numes of annual corporate govern-\nance case studies, Prof Mak said he\ndecided to bring SFIA and CP AAto-\ngether –withSFIA recognising\nCPAA’s commitment to promoting\nESG among its members.\nOn the team of experts that he’s\nbrought together to helm the re-\nports, Prof Mak likens assembling\nthem to that of the Marvel Comics’\nAvengers –albeit, he quips, a\n“slightly nerdy version” –withev-\neryone bringing something differ-\nent to the table.\nThe purpose of such an assemb-\nly is to produce aserieso fr eports,\nwith “Integratin gESG Factors Into\nExecutive Remuneration” being the\nfirst.\n“Our plan is that this would be a\nregularseriescoveringdifferentar-\neas of ESG, including emerging ar-\neas. The next issue is expected to\nbe on climate risk, such as how cli-mate riskaffects various outcomes\nsuch as cost of capital; an dthere\nwill be reports on ESG issues in\nsupply chains, implications of ESG\nfor directors’ duties, and account-\ning and disclosure issues relating\nto ESG.”\nBut he intends to let the specif-\nics of future reports be determined\nby the experts that will headline\nthem. The initial grou pi smade up\nof5i ndivid uals, including Prof\nMak:\n■Associate Professor Lan Luh\nLuh, associate professor o flaw at\nthe National University of Singa-\npore (NUS), who specialises in com-\npany law ,corporate fi nance law\nandcorporate gover nance;\n■Professor Christopher Tang,a\ndistinguished professor at the\nUCLA Anderson School of Manage-\nment, regarded as aforemost\nscholar of global supply chain\nmanagement;\n■Professor Ho YewKee, associate\nprovost at the Singapore Institute\nofTechnology ,whomProf Mak\nsays will bring strong expertise in\naccounting, finance and invest-\nments and is engaged in ESG issues\nin the investment committees of\nnot-for-profits he serves on ;and\n■Dr Khoo Guan Seng, adata scien-\ntist with adoctorate in computa-tional physics, whom Prof Mak de-\nscribes as being an expert on cli-\nmate risk issues, with considerable\npractical experience in ESG issues\nthrough his manage ment a nd advi-\nsory roles at financial institutions,\nasset management companies,\nsovereign wealth funds and other\norganisations.\n“I cast the net wide,” Prof Mak\nsaid. “I approached anumber of in-\ndividuals who have deep knowl-\nedge about different areas of ESG. I\nwas particularly careful to avoid\nacademics who are overnight CG or\nESG experts. Iamhumbled that\nthey agreed to work with me on\nthis and wer enot looking for finan-\ncial rewards.”\nAs for how frequently one can\nexpect these publications, Prof\nMak said the team intends to issue\n4reports ayear.\n“And, over time, we will need to\nexpand the group –like Phase 2and\nPhase 3i nt he Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse –but no one will be killed\noff,” he quips.\nThereport ,“Integratin gESG\nFactors Into Executive\nRemun eration” ,isavailable\nat Prof Mak’s website: https://\ngovernanceforstakeholde rs.\ncom/By M ichelle Quah\nmichquah @sph.com.sgAssembling the ‘Avengers’: developing practicable ESG research for businessesPublication: The Business Times\nDate: 23 May 2022\nHeadline: Assembling the 'Avengers': developing\npracticable ESG research  for business\nSource: The Business Times © SPH Media Limited.
