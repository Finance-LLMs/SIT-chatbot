    "Revolutionise the Future with Applied Artificial Intelligence",
    "SIT's new BSc (Hons) in Applied Artificial Intelligence programme aims to nurture talents to lead Singapore’s Smart Nation transformation.",
    "From dating apps and facial recognition to telemedicine and autonomous vehicles, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionised interpersonal interactions, business models, and even the way public services are delivered.",
    "As humans increasingly rely on machine learning to analyse large amounts of data, AI is utilised to find patterns and help arrive at decisions. ‘Applied AI’ brings artificial intelligence out of the lab and into the real world, enabling computers to execute tasks through programming and engineering.",
    "Understanding how AI works is great but knowing how to implement it in industry or a job role is a crucial step towards changing the technological landscape. For example, you might be able to use AI to",
    "detect financial fraud",
    "by observing suspicious transaction data (including issues like the recent",
    "OCBC phishing scam",
    "). AI can also target energy inefficiencies – a step to potentially",
    "reducing greenhouse gas pollution by half by 2050",
    ". AI algorithms are also used in the",
    "movie industry",
    "for everything from sorting scripts to predicting box office success before a film is even greenlit.",
    "Whatever industry you choose to work in, you can be almost certain AI will be (or already has been) implemented. This is why Singapore has identified AI as a key technology to be harnessed for",
    "Singapore’s Smart Nation",
    "transformation. As such, there is an urgent demand for engineers skilled in AI implementation across various sectors, both locally and globally.",
    "The world needs more AI engineers locally and globally",
    "According to",
    "International Data Corporation (IDC)",
    ", worldwide spending on AI systems is expected to more than double from 2021 to 2025. In Singapore, several initiatives have been put in place to build a vibrant AI eco-system for sustained innovation and commitment to AI research and development, as well as the training of 25,000 AI-proficient professionals by 2025.",
    "To meet the growing demand for professionals skilled in AI coding and implementation, the",
    "Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)",
    "is rolling out the",
    "Bachelor of Science with Honours in Applied Artificial Intelligence",
    "(AAI) this year.",
    "Through core training in software engineering, machine learning, and professional skills, the AAI programme aims to provide a strong talent pipeline of AI engineers proficient in developing, deploying, and maintaining AI systems across multiple industry sectors.",
    "As part of SIT’s applied learning pedagogy, you will be exposed to industry projects staged across various fields, such as fintech, engineering, and healthcare. By intentionally building real-world projects into the programme curriculum, you will be trained to implement AI within a wide range of industry settings.",
    "The AAI programme is welcomed by partners such as Amazon Web Services, and has received endorsement from the national AI programme, AI Singapore.",
    "“Technology is redefining our workforce and the skills needed to remain competitive. We are delighted to see institutes of higher learning like SIT taking the initiative to integrate AI and machine learning into their education programmes to help develop the next generation of cloud computing professionals” – Peter Moore, Regional Managing Director, Global Public Sector (Asia Pacific and Japan), Amazon Web Services Worldwide.",
    "Focusing on technical skills and teamwork",
    "As a specialised programme that focuses on implementing AI within software systems, AAI comprises key modules such as machine learning, computer vision and deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).",
    "The programme provides in-depth training in three focus areas:",
    "Core Software Engineering",
    "as the bedrock of foundational software development, essential for mastery of machine learning skills. This includes topics such as cloud computing, big data, and DevOps, learned over 12 core software engineering modules.",
    "Core Machine Learning",
    "will equip you with skills on how AI models can be developed, applied, and deployed, taught over 9 core AI modules.",
    "Professional Skills",
    "to equip you with the relevant soft skills to put forth your ideas clearly and confidently to various stakeholders.",
    "The AAI programme is unique in that it is project-intensive, with projects delivered through:",
    "Integrative Team Project (ITP)",
    ": You will be exposed to existing contemporary industry problem statements in order to design and develop an interdisciplinary solution.",
    "Embedded domain specific projects:",
    "You will work in groups of 4-5 and be attached to different companies and domains to focus on the industry and its software engineering practices.",
    "Applied industry projects:",
    "You will perform your capstone project concurrently with IWSP in your final year, allowing you to work on projects based on a relevant area or problem faced by the IWSP company.",
    "The Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) is an eight-month work attachment and an integral feature of SIT’s degree programmes. You will develop important work skills in AI, preparing you for a seamless transition to employment. By the time you graduate, you will have accumulated over a year’s worth of real-world experience, with competencies such as data collection, data engineering, model training, and model deployment.",
    "Be a part of the AI revolution",
    "It is undeniable that someday, AI will replace a lot of jobs that humans do, but it will also create many more opportunities in the field.",
    "With a BSc (Hons) in Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) degree, you can gain a foothold in the rapidly-developing AI scene, where graduates can look forward to roles like AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, and AI Application Engineer.",
    "This three-year direct honours programme starts in September 2022.",

For example, you might be able to use AI to\ndetect financial fraud\nby observing suspicious transaction data (including issues like the recent\nOCBC phishing scam\n). AI can also target energy inefficiencies – a step to potentially\nreducing greenhouse gas pollution by half by 2050\n. AI algorithms are also used in the\nmovie industry\nfor everything from sorting scripts to predicting box office success before a film is even greenlit.\nWhatever industry you choose to work in, you can be almost certain AI will be (or already has been) implemented. This is why Singapore has identified AI as a key technology to be harnessed for\nSingapore’s Smart Nation\ntransformation. As such, there is an urgent demand for engineers skilled in AI implementation across various sectors, both locally and globally.\nThe world needs more AI engineers locally and globally\nAccording to\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC)\n, worldwide spending on AI systems is expected to more than double from 2021 to 2025. In Singapore, several initiatives have been put in place to build a vibrant AI eco-system for sustained innovation and commitment to AI research and development, as well as the training of 25,000 AI-proficient professionals by 2025.\nTo meet the growing demand for professionals skilled in AI coding and implementation, the\nSingapore Institute of Technology (SIT)\nis rolling out the\nBachelor of Science with Honours in Applied Artificial Intelligence\n(AAI) this year.\nThrough core training in software engineering, machine learning, and professional skills, the AAI programme aims to provide a strong talent pipeline of AI engineers proficient in developing, deploying, and maintaining AI systems across multiple industry sectors.\nAs part of SIT’s applied learning pedagogy, you will be exposed to industry projects staged across various fields, such as fintech, engineering, and healthcare. By intentionally building real-world projects into the programme curriculum, you will be trained to implement AI within a wide range of industry settings.\nThe AAI programme is welcomed by partners such as Amazon Web Services, and has received endorsement from the national AI programme, AI Singapore.\n“Technology is redefining our workforce and the skills needed to remain competitive. We are delighted to see institutes of higher learning like SIT taking the initiative to integrate AI and machine learning into their education programmes to help develop the next generation of cloud computing professionals” – Peter Moore, Regional Managing Director, Global Public Sector (Asia Pacific and Japan), Amazon Web Services Worldwide.\nFocusing on technical skills and teamwork\nAs a specialised programme that focuses on implementing AI within software systems, AAI comprises key modules such as machine learning, computer vision and deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).\nThe programme provides in-depth training in three focus areas:\nCore Software Engineering\nas the bedrock of foundational software development, essential for mastery of machine learning skills. This includes topics such as cloud computing, big data, and DevOps, learned over 12 core software engineering modules.\nCore Machine Learning\nwill equip you with skills on how AI models can be developed, applied, and deployed, taught over 9 core AI modules.\nProfessional Skills\nto equip you with the relevant soft skills to put forth your ideas clearly and confidently to various stakeholders.\nThe AAI programme is unique in that it is project-intensive, with projects delivered through:\nIntegrative Team Project (ITP)\n: You will be exposed to existing contemporary industry problem statements in order to design and develop an interdisciplinary solution.\nEmbedded domain specific projects:\nYou will work in groups of 4-5 and be attached to different companies and domains to focus on the industry and its software engineering practices.\nApplied industry projects:\nYou will perform your capstone project concurrently with IWSP in your final year, allowing you to work on projects based on a relevant area or problem faced by the IWSP company.\nThe Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) is an eight-month work attachment and an integral feature of SIT’s degree programmes. You will develop important work skills in AI, preparing you for a seamless transition to employment. By the time you graduate, you will have accumulated over a year’s worth of real-world experience, with competencies such as data collection, data engineering, model training, and model deployment.\nBe a part of the AI revolution\nIt is undeniable that someday, AI will replace a lot of jobs that humans do, but it will also create many more opportunities in the field.\nWith a BSc (Hons) in Applied Artificial Intelligence (AAI) degree, you can gain a foothold in the rapidly-developing AI scene, where graduates can look forward to roles like AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, and AI Application Engineer.\nThis three-year direct honours programme starts in September 2022.\nApplications for admission to SIT close on 19 March 2022\n.\nVisit\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/admissions\nto find out more.\nThis article first appeared in\nCampus\n.\nTopics\nFeatures\nAdmissions\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nInfocomm Technology\nAcademic Clusters\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nThe Ngee Ann Kongsi Formalises Intention to Donate S$25m in Support of Library and Fund to Nurture Emerging Talents and Ideas at SIT\nview\nNext\nWhy You Should be a Part of the Digital Supply Chain Industry\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
