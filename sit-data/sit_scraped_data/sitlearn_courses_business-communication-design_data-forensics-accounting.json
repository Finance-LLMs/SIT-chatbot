    "You will learn how to plan, design, and apply numerous data analytics tests, including examining and interpreting the results of those tests, to identify the red flags of fraud.",
    "The first day of the course aims to build a strong foundation of data analytical skills by reviewing the types of fraud schemes and examples of data analytics tests that can be performed to detect the warning signs of such schemes. The various data analysis techniques that include both supervised and unsupervised learning for fraud or anomaly detection will be covered in detail.",
    "On day two, you will go through experiential learning where you will apply your knowledge of analytical tests, data sources, and fraud schemes to real data sets and scenarios to uncover trends and patterns in the data.",
    "As we are moving towards safeguarding against financial crime, employees equipped with the skills of data analysis and forensics investigation are at the forefront of fighting against financial crime.",

    "9:00 am – 6:00 pm",
    "Anti-fraud Data Analytics Tests",
    "When reviewing a company’s financial statements, certain undesirable characteristics may stand out as fraud red flags. Participants will learn how to integrate data analytics tests into fraud risk assessment or investigative work plans through a library of test examples that is organised by categories of occupational fraud risks, such as corruption, bribery, asset misappropriation and financial statement fraud.",
    "Data Fundamentals",
    "This session will introduce participants to the uses, benefits and challenges of data analytics techniques, as well as the types of data that can be analysed using available software options to perform data analysis tests.",
    "Data Analysis Techniques",
    "Participants will discuss many of the most common data analysis techniques — such as duplicate testing, matching, gap testing and rule-based analytics — that can be used to comb through the data and identify anomalies and red flags of fraud. They will then progress to more sophisticated analysis techniques such as Benford's Law analysis, regression analysis, risk scoring and machine learning to bring fraud detection efforts to the next level. Modern technology also allows for the handling of Big Data with analytics techniques on unstructured data such as text analytics as well as visual, timeline analytics, and transactional risk-ranking techniques that incorporate time intelligence and drill-down capability.",
    "Day 2",
    "9:00 am – 6:00 pm",
    "Case Study 1: Financial Statement Fraud",
    "This session explores specific data tests that participants can use to spot red flags of fraud in the customer sales cycle in their organisations. They will apply the data analytics techniques by working on a hands-on case study using spreadsheets.",
    "Case Study 2: Detecting Corruption & Misappropriation of Cash",
    "Discussion scenarios will be used to walk through data analytics techniques to analyse the structured and unstructured data in which warning signs of corruption schemes and misappropriation of cash are often found.",
    "Case Study 3: Expense Reimbursement Fraud",
    "This session focuses on data analysis techniques to uncover fraud schemes within expense reimbursements. Participants will apply the data analytics by working on a hands-on case study involving expense reimbursement fraud using a business intelligence tool. They will learn how to navigate dashboards and perform effective dashboard actions to uncover anomalies in data.",
