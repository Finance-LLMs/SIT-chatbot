    "Keeping Abreast of Developments",
    "As a supply manager in the ship bunker industry, Dilys is heavily involved in procuring the best fuels for her clients, according to their needs.",
    "Seeing first-hand how her work has changed in the past year, with more customers requesting alternative fuels such as Biofuel and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) stems, Dilys wanted to move quickly to learn more about maritime decarbonisation, “especially because accelerated climate change has also made it more urgent to decarbonise quicker than initially anticipated,” she added.",
    "The Masterclass was crucial for Dilys to understand the needs of her clients better.",

    "“Learning about the decarbonisation technologies and alternative fuels – especially with hard data and concrete real-world examples – filled the knowledge gaps and helped me understand the viability of different fuels for different bunkers,” Dilys shared.",
    "“Ultimately, the knowledge gained from the course gave me greater confidence to deal with my clients and speak to them about alternative fuels, as I was able to steer conversations in the right direction to provide them with solutions.”",
    "Diving Deep into Learning",
    "One of the things Dilys particularly appreciated was the comprehensive content presented to her in the Masterclass, which she found to be very informative.",

    "Determined to make the most of the material given, Dilys dove right into her folder of data, information, and examples with gusto. “I went home and spent my night reading through it all,” she said. “Of course, it was optional, but I felt it helped me absorb the material more quickly the next day.”",
    "The course is a great one for beginners to attend, in Dilys’ opinion, because the concept of maritime decarbonisation was introduced progressively and built upon by the teaching team.",
    "The 11-member teaching team comprises Associate Professors Wang Xin and Tay Chuan Beng, Assistant Professors Wong Wee Chin and Elsa Feng, as well as industry professionals.",
    "“I’m not a shipping expert by any stretch, so hearing from experts and professionals from all aspects of the industry was very helpful.
