    "Charting a Safer, More Sustainable Maritime Future",
    "Liu Yongsheng is developing a framework to make it safer for vessels to use liquid hydrogen as a fuel, a project his Industrial Masters at SIT has equipped him for.",
    "Fossil fuels are out of fashion. Instead, renewable energy sources have emerged as alternatives in most industries, including the maritime sector. Liquified gases, in particular, have been touted as the future of maritime fuel.",
    "However, these volatile gases pose significant risks, forcing the industry to delay their adoption while it explores safe ways to use them. And with the climate clock ticking down, the industry is working hard to meet its sustainability targets.",
    "Liu Yongsheng",
    ", a 2023 graduate of",
    "SIT's Master of Engineering programme",
    "under the Industrial Masters (IM) initiative, is spearheading a groundbreaking project to make the transportation of liquid hydrogen at sea safer and more reliable. “The project focuses on identifying critical safety events aboard vessels carrying liquid hydrogen and developing a safety design framework for designers and engineers working on these vessels,” explained Yongsheng, who started the project as part of his IM which he began in 2020. He graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Naval Architecture at SIT in 2016.",
    "The IM programme is designed for professionals to deepen their technical expertise through industrial research and development, while preparing them for leadership positions in the industry.",
    "Yongsheng’s project has since yielded a framework which identifies critical safety events, risks and design factors necessary to ensure crew safety, such as failure detection, mitigation, and corrective actions to prevent an incident from escalating into the loss of a vessel. It also emphasises human error and sensor reliability as key considerations for maintaining safe operations onboard vessels carrying liquid hydrogen.",
    "Liu Yongsheng (second from right) with his coursemates on Graduation day! (Photo: Liu Yongsheng)",
    "Diving Deep for Data",
    "But the project was not all smooth sailing, said the 35-year-old, now an assistant manager at marine engineering company Seatrium.",
    "Likening it to entering uncharted waters, he said, “There is a lack of accessibility to practical information and data related to liquid hydrogen onboard vessels.”",
    "The challenge is not a new one—the lack of reliable data is a perennial problem for the maritime industry, where many of its processes are still documented using pen and paper. This makes it difficult for organisations to share data.",
    "Additionally, information on the use of liquid hydrogen as a fuel is sparse because the concept is new. “Academic papers do not have information on liquid hydrogen specifically, or at least any that is publicly available,” Yongsheng said.",
    "But obtaining accurate information is critical as the highly flammable gas can endanger whole vessels if mishandled. Yongsheng had to turn to other industries, such as the automobile sector, which had already incorporated liquid hydrogen systems.",
    "While the data was helpful, he had to ensure it was accurate by approaching various stakeholders to validate the information he planned to use in his project.",
    "“I had no problem finding designers and engineers – Seatrium has lots of them involved in projects related to liquified gases,” he recalled. “But I struggled to find people who worked in regulatory bodies.” He needed their input to ensure the framework and identification of critical safety events were as accurate as possible.",
    "Thankfully, his professor at SIT connected him to a contact at DNV – an internationally accredited registrar and classification society headquartered in Norway – who helped to co-review the information used for the project.",
    "The access to relevant stakeholders was particularly valuable during Yongsheng’s IM, which coincided with the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Online meetings made communication with stakeholders more difficult, he said. “Certain discussions are just easier in person. But thankfully, most of the data and information I needed was online, so it was still doable.”",
    "The expertise in process safety he gained from his project has expanded his role at Seatrium. “Previously, I was focused on only one skill set as a naval architect focused on the constructability of vessels. But now, I am also involved in process safety, something that is becoming increasingly important as processes get more and more complex,” he said.  His expanded skill set earned him a promotion from Senior Engineer to Assistant Manager.",
    "Yongsheng giving a team briefing at Seatrium. (Photo: Liu Yongsheng)",
    "Forging Ahead for a Safer Future",
    "While Yongsheng has completed his IM at SIT, he continues to work on the safety framework at Seatrium. “We have the proposed framework, but we need to gather more information and test the framework to validate it,” he explained. One way is to implement it on a vessel; another is to run simulations on research vessels.",
    "Despite the long runway ahead, he is determined to continue developing the framework further. “If there is an opportunity, I would love to expand the project by taking up a PhD. It is a complex project, and a PhD would provide me with more resources and knowledge to dive deeper.”",
    "Innovation, he says, is the key to a safer, more sustainable maritime future. “It is a very challenging period ahead for the industry with so much changing. Engineers will have a lot of technology and knowledge they must pick up,” he noted, adding that the maritime industry should learn from other industries to enhance its operations.",
    "Yongsheng credits SIT’s IM programme for equipping him with a strong foundation to navigate the complexities of the maritime industry. The programme provided a platform to merge academic research with practical applications, enabling him to tackle real-world challenges and contribute to a more sustainable future for the industry.",
    "Relishing what lies ahead, he said: “I love learning, especially from other industries that can inject new technology and information into the maritime industry. It allows me to think out of the box and reminds me that it’s not just doing what you have always been doing.”",

Instead, renewable energy sources have emerged as alternatives in most industries, including the maritime sector. Liquified gases, in particular, have been touted as the future of maritime fuel.\nHowever, these volatile gases pose significant risks, forcing the industry to delay their adoption while it explores safe ways to use them. And with the climate clock ticking down, the industry is working hard to meet its sustainability targets.\nLiu Yongsheng\n, a 2023 graduate of\nSIT's Master of Engineering programme\nunder the Industrial Masters (IM) initiative, is spearheading a groundbreaking project to make the transportation of liquid hydrogen at sea safer and more reliable. “The project focuses on identifying critical safety events aboard vessels carrying liquid hydrogen and developing a safety design framework for designers and engineers working on these vessels,” explained Yongsheng, who started the project as part of his IM which he began in 2020. He graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Naval Architecture at SIT in 2016.\nThe IM programme is designed for professionals to deepen their technical expertise through industrial research and development, while preparing them for leadership positions in the industry.\nYongsheng’s project has since yielded a framework which identifies critical safety events, risks and design factors necessary to ensure crew safety, such as failure detection, mitigation, and corrective actions to prevent an incident from escalating into the loss of a vessel. It also emphasises human error and sensor reliability as key considerations for maintaining safe operations onboard vessels carrying liquid hydrogen.\nLiu Yongsheng (second from right) with his coursemates on Graduation day! (Photo: Liu Yongsheng)\nDiving Deep for Data\nBut the project was not all smooth sailing, said the 35-year-old, now an assistant manager at marine engineering company Seatrium.\nLikening it to entering uncharted waters, he said, “There is a lack of accessibility to practical information and data related to liquid hydrogen onboard vessels.”\nThe challenge is not a new one—the lack of reliable data is a perennial problem for the maritime industry, where many of its processes are still documented using pen and paper. This makes it difficult for organisations to share data.\nAdditionally, information on the use of liquid hydrogen as a fuel is sparse because the concept is new. “Academic papers do not have information on liquid hydrogen specifically, or at least any that is publicly available,” Yongsheng said.\nBut obtaining accurate information is critical as the highly flammable gas can endanger whole vessels if mishandled. Yongsheng had to turn to other industries, such as the automobile sector, which had already incorporated liquid hydrogen systems.\nWhile the data was helpful, he had to ensure it was accurate by approaching various stakeholders to validate the information he planned to use in his project.\n“I had no problem finding designers and engineers – Seatrium has lots of them involved in projects related to liquified gases,” he recalled. “But I struggled to find people who worked in regulatory bodies.” He needed their input to ensure the framework and identification of critical safety events were as accurate as possible.\nThankfully, his professor at SIT connected him to a contact at DNV – an internationally accredited registrar and classification society headquartered in Norway – who helped to co-review the information used for the project.\nThe access to relevant stakeholders was particularly valuable during Yongsheng’s IM, which coincided with the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Online meetings made communication with stakeholders more difficult, he said. “Certain discussions are just easier in person. But thankfully, most of the data and information I needed was online, so it was still doable.”\nThe expertise in process safety he gained from his project has expanded his role at Seatrium. “Previously, I was focused on only one skill set as a naval architect focused on the constructability of vessels. But now, I am also involved in process safety, something that is becoming increasingly important as processes get more and more complex,” he said.  His expanded skill set earned him a promotion from Senior Engineer to Assistant Manager.\nYongsheng giving a team briefing at Seatrium. (Photo: Liu Yongsheng)\nForging Ahead for a Safer Future\nWhile Yongsheng has completed his IM at SIT, he continues to work on the safety framework at Seatrium. “We have the proposed framework, but we need to gather more information and test the framework to validate it,” he explained. One way is to implement it on a vessel; another is to run simulations on research vessels.\nDespite the long runway ahead, he is determined to continue developing the framework further. “If there is an opportunity, I would love to expand the project by taking up a PhD. It is a complex project, and a PhD would provide me with more resources and knowledge to dive deeper.”\nInnovation, he says, is the key to a safer, more sustainable maritime future. “It is a very challenging period ahead for the industry with so much changing. Engineers will have a lot of technology and knowledge they must pick up,” he noted, adding that the maritime industry should learn from other industries to enhance its operations.\nYongsheng credits SIT’s IM programme for equipping him with a strong foundation to navigate the complexities of the maritime industry. The programme provided a platform to merge academic research with practical applications, enabling him to tackle real-world challenges and contribute to a more sustainable future for the industry.\nRelishing what lies ahead, he said: “I love learning, especially from other industries that can inject new technology and information into the maritime industry. It allows me to think out of the box and reminds me that it’s not just doing what you have always been doing.”\nTopics\nAlumni\nSITizens\nIndustry\nEngineering\nLifelong Learning\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nApplied Research & Innovation\nIndustry & Community\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nNo Reservations: Committed to Grooming the Next Generation of Hoteliers\nview\nNext\nLab Culture: Raising the Next Generation With An Innovative Mindset\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences"
