    "Nurturing the Talent Pool for Maritime 4.0",
    "Five SIT students have been awarded the MaritimeONE Scholarship, which",
    "offers a pathway into the maritime industry for those with a passion to make a difference in an exciting sector.",
    "As a former Marine Systems Operator in the Republic of Singapore Navy, Jesphne Koh is no stranger to drama on the high seas. “Anything can happen out at sea, especially after long hours. During multilateral exercises, there were times where the main engine encountered an emergency stop, a generator pipe leaked, or the evaporator broke down,” she recounts. “Together with the engineering team, my job was to make sure that our marine systems are operationally ready 24/7 and remain in good condition throughout the sail.”",
    "After working for more than five years, Jesphne, 26, decided to head for shore and hit the books. She is currently furthering her studies by reading the Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in",
    "Marine Engineering",
    ",",
    "which is jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University. The programme gives students exposure to marine engineering systems – from the main propulsion engines to auxiliary machineries such as power generators, pumps, heat exchangers, and other machinery within water, air, and hydraulic systems. Besides rigorous academic training, they also get the opportunity to do their Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) with leading marine and offshore engineering organisations such as Keppel O&M Ltd, Sembcorp Marine Ltd, Singapore Technologies Marine Ltd, and Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd.",
    "Jesphne is one of 42 students pursing maritime-related courses who has been awarded the MaritimeONE Scholarship. The scholarship programme is spearheaded by the Singapore Maritime Foundation and is a key initiative to nurture talent for Singapore’s maritime industry. Scholarships are funded by institutes of higher learning and companies in the maritime industry, including port, shipping, maritime services, and shipyards.",
    "“I have always wanted a career that isn’t desk-bound, where each day is unpredictable and part of an ever-learning journey,” said Jesphne, who earned the Sembcorp Marine-MaritimeONE Scholarship. “The maritime industry is constantly growing and to keep pace, I know I need a degree that is industry-focussed and targeted at growth sectors of the economy.”",
    "From left: Marine Engineering students",

    "The five SIT students who received the scholarships are:",

    "Pang Jia Shen (Marine Engineering) – The Chua Chor Teck Memorial Fund-MaritimeONE Scholarship",
    "Tileron Laurette Zachary Lacang (",
    "Naval Architecture",
    ") – Wilhelmsen-MaritimeONE Scholarship",
    "Fellow Marine Engineering student Muhammad Afiq Bin Azman, 23, is a recipient of the ABS-MaritimeONE Scholarship. He was drawn to the maritime industry because of the crucial role it plays in Singapore’s economic development and the opportunity it affords him to work with diverse groups of people. For him, the defining experience was his internship at Pacific International Lines Pte Ltd, which he undertook when he was studying Marine Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic. Afiq sailed onboard a container vessel as an Engine Cadet, where he met people of different nationalities and gained hands-on experience on the ship.",
    "His dream is to become a marine surveyor. “From my experience working onboard a ship, safety is a priority. As a marine surveyor, I would be able to ensure that ships meet the regulatory requirements for the safety and well-being of those working onboard,” said Afiq. “It would also give me exposure to the work on different types of ships.”",

During multilateral exercises, there were times where the main engine encountered an emergency stop, a generator pipe leaked, or the evaporator broke down,” she recounts. “Together with the engineering team, my job was to make sure that our marine systems are operationally ready 24/7 and remain in good condition throughout the sail.”\nAfter working for more than five years, Jesphne, 26, decided to head for shore and hit the books. She is currently furthering her studies by reading the Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in\nMarine Engineering\n,\nwhich is jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University. The programme gives students exposure to marine engineering systems – from the main propulsion engines to auxiliary machineries such as power generators, pumps, heat exchangers, and other machinery within water, air, and hydraulic systems. Besides rigorous academic training, they also get the opportunity to do their Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) with leading marine and offshore engineering organisations such as Keppel O&M Ltd, Sembcorp Marine Ltd, Singapore Technologies Marine Ltd, and Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd.\nJesphne is one of 42 students pursing maritime-related courses who has been awarded the MaritimeONE Scholarship. The scholarship programme is spearheaded by the Singapore Maritime Foundation and is a key initiative to nurture talent for Singapore’s maritime industry. Scholarships are funded by institutes of higher learning and companies in the maritime industry, including port, shipping, maritime services, and shipyards.\n“I have always wanted a career that isn’t desk-bound, where each day is unpredictable and part of an ever-learning journey,” said Jesphne, who earned the Sembcorp Marine-MaritimeONE Scholarship. “The maritime industry is constantly growing and to keep pace, I know I need a degree that is industry-focussed and targeted at growth sectors of the economy.”\nFrom left: Marine Engineering students\nAmos Tham and Pang Jia Shen, and Naval Architecture student Tileron Laurette Zachary Lacang.\nThe five SIT students who received the scholarships are:\nJesphne Koh (Marine Engineering) – Sembcorp Marine-MaritimeONE Scholarship\nMuhammad Afiq Bin Azman (Marine Engineering) – ABS-MaritimeONE Scholarship\nAmos Tham (Marine Engineering) – The Chua Chor Teck Memorial Fund-MaritimeONE Scholarship\nPang Jia Shen (Marine Engineering) – The Chua Chor Teck Memorial Fund-MaritimeONE Scholarship\nTileron Laurette Zachary Lacang (\nNaval Architecture\n) – Wilhelmsen-MaritimeONE Scholarship\nFellow Marine Engineering student Muhammad Afiq Bin Azman, 23, is a recipient of the ABS-MaritimeONE Scholarship. He was drawn to the maritime industry because of the crucial role it plays in Singapore’s economic development and the opportunity it affords him to work with diverse groups of people. For him, the defining experience was his internship at Pacific International Lines Pte Ltd, which he undertook when he was studying Marine Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic. Afiq sailed onboard a container vessel as an Engine Cadet, where he met people of different nationalities and gained hands-on experience on the ship.\nHis dream is to become a marine surveyor. “From my experience working onboard a ship, safety is a priority. As a marine surveyor, I would be able to ensure that ships meet the regulatory requirements for the safety and well-being of those working onboard,” said Afiq. “It would also give me exposure to the work on different types of ships.”\nTopics\nFeatures\nAwards\nMarine\nSITizens\nCATEGORIES\nAcademic Clusters\nEngineering\nSITizens & Campus\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nSIT Trumps 67 Teams to Win BECC 2021\nview\nNext\nThe Promise of VR for Patient Rehabilitation\nview\nRelated News\n26 Mar 2025\nPower Through Emotion\nSIT, Chemistry and Pod of Life unveil a new approach to combat workplace burnout through The Emotional Baggage Board Game.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Academic Clusters, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n18 Sep 2024\nOCBC to Invest $500 Million in Punggol Digital District\nInvestment includes a multi-million-dollar strategic partnership with SIT\ntag\nPress Releases, Industry & Community, Academic Clusters, Business, Communication and Design, Infocomm Technology\n23 Jun 2023\nHelping Mental Health Patients Lead Meaningful Lives\nCognitive remediation expert A/Prof Tan Bhing Leet was recently awarded the 2023 Connie Lieber Science to Practice Award for Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry.\ntag\nAcademic Clusters, Health and Social Sciences"
