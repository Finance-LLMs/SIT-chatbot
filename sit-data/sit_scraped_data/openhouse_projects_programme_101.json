    "Modeling and Simulation of SIT-Punggol Microgrid",
    "This academic poster illustrates a student’s design of the SIT-Punggol microgrid model which integrates a solar photovoltaic system and energy storage batteries. The project also performed verification of the active and reactive power control system performance to support grid-connected and island operations.",

    "Electrical Power Engineering",
    "Development of Data Analytics Model for Condition Monitoring",
    "This video demonstrates how a data-driven model using IoT sensor data can be implemented to continuously monitor the condition of the electrical assets and detect anomalies. The developed system also recommends maintenance cycle index (MCI) for the electrical assets based on the asset utilisation, asset availability, and pattern of failure analysis.",
