    "From SIT to Shanghai: An Alumnus’ Journey into China’s Silicon Valley",
    "James Ow Yang Shin embarked on a transformative journey at one of China’s leading tech innovators, an opportunity made possible by the prestigious Singapore Valley Awards.",
    "For most undergraduates, internships are about applying what they’ve learnt in the classroom to real-world challenges. For James Ow Yang Shin, an SIT Mechanical Engineering alumnus who graduated in 2023, his internship in Shanghai was more than that—it was a transformative journey of growth, independence, and adaptability. And it all started with winning the prestigious",
    "Singapore Valley Awards",
    "(SVA) 2024.",
    "About the Award",
    "The SVA challenges applicants to craft compelling business plans and brand narratives to impress a panel of esteemed judges. These judges, drawn from venture capital firms, and the tech industry, evaluate applicants during an intensive pitch session.",
    "Open to full-time undergraduates from Singapore’s six autonomous universities, the winners – one selected from each university – receive the coveted Singapore Valley Award, a $2,000 cash prize and a prestigious overseas internship experience in a Chinese tech firm, with internship expenses covered by Enterprise Singapore Global Ready Talent Programme. SVA is supported by Tembusu Partners, a Singapore-based private equity firm which believes in fostering entrepreneurial talent and providing young Singaporeans with exposure to China's dynamic business landscape.",
    "“I participated in SVA to get one step closer to my ambition of being a robotics or tech entrepreneur,” James shared. Recognising it as a unique opportunity to gain exposure to China's vibrant tech landscape, James knew this was a chance to push himself beyond his comfort zone.",
    "The Path to Winning",
    "It was not an easy win for James. It began with a short questionnaire where James had to explain his business idea. For over a week, he worked on a detailed presentation deck to pitch his concept—an innovative idea for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) robotics aimed at addressing challenges in Singapore’s manufacturing industry, particularly in high mix-low volume tasks that conventional robotics cannot easily manage.",
    "“I believe my submission stood out because it was both innovative and practical, solving a key problem in Singapore’s manufacturing sector,” James explained. During the pitch, he shared not only his business concept but also his desire for the internship experience. “I was willing to pause my engineering career to undergo this entrepreneurship experience, and I think that resonated with the judges,” he added.",
    "Applicants were assessed based on their ideas, pitch delivery, and personality. Winning the SVA wasn’t just an accolade for James—it was his ticket to CTP Parking, a company at the forefront of electronic parking solutions in China.",
    "James spent 3 months in CTP Parking as an intern from June to August 2024. (Photo: James Ow)",
    "A Crash Course in Sales, Business, and Culture",
    "When James joined CTP Parking for his internship in June 2024, his role as a hardware engineer was clear. However, it didn’t take long for him to transition into sales and business development, a pivot that allowed him to engage directly with China’s fast-paced business environment. His workdays were divided into two segments: mornings dedicated to researching companies and startups, and afternoons spent at tech expos. Although the expos weren’t part of his job, James seized the opportunity to explore cutting-edge innovations and immerse himself in China’s technological advancements.",
    "James with A/Prof Eugene Wong, Director of Programmes of SIT’s Engineering cluster, who introduced him to the Singapore Valley Awards. (Photo: James Ow)",
    "“I went to Shanghai to learn how business is done there. Observing investor presentations during board meetings gave me firsthand insights into how deals are made in one of the world’s most competitive markets,” he explained.",
    "The experience, however, wasn’t without its challenges. With its mix of Chinese dialects and technical terms, the language barrier initially posed a hurdle. James added, “Tools like Google Translate helped me a lot in times like this!”",
    "“The education I received at SIT prepared me well for the challenges in Shanghai,” James noted. On his first day, he was able to grasp the design software and system architecture used in the company, thanks to his hands-on learning in SIT’s Mechanical Engineering programme. “This allowed me to provide value-added feedback and design insights immediately,” he said.",
    "Navigating Independence, A Fast-Paced Work Lifestyle and... An Overstayed Visa",
    "Living alone in a foreign city also meant learning to be independent. From renting an apartment to managing his day-to-day affairs, James embraced the freedom and responsibility of living abroad.",
    "“I came to Shanghai alone, but I left with a network of friends,” James shared fondly, recalling the networking events he attended in the city. These events introduced him to other interns, with whom he explored Shanghai’s vibrant social scene—from gaming nights to a visit to Disneyland Shanghai.",
    "Newly made friends are part of James' biggest takeaways from his internship. (Photo: James Ow)",
    "James’ experience extended beyond professional skills. The fast-paced working environment in Shanghai, where many companies operate on the intense 996 schedule (9am to 9pm, six days a week), was a culture shock. While CTP Parking followed regular hours, James observed the relentless drive of the locals. “People in Shanghai live and work at a speed I wasn’t used to,” he reflected. But instead of being overwhelmed, he learned to thrive in this environment, balancing work responsibilities with personal growth.",
    "Near the end of his internship in August, James overstayed his visa due to a misunderstanding about required permits. He got booked for overstaying! The incident led to a fine and a delayed return to Singapore. While it was stressful then, James saw it as a learning experience that added to the thrills of his Shanghai adventure.",
    "A Launchpad for Success",
    "Upon returning to Singapore, James secured a role as a robotics engineer at Temasek Polytechnic, where he focuses on sourcing and working with manufacturing clients. He credits his Shanghai experience for preparing him for the challenges of this role.",
    "“The combination of technical and business skills I gained in Shanghai made me stand out,” he said. The independence he developed abroad also gave him the confidence to excel in interviews and navigate complex work environments. For SIT students considering similar opportunities, James has some words of wisdom: “Be comfortable with the uncomfortable. Stepping out of your comfort zone is where the real learning begins.”",

For James Ow Yang Shin, an SIT Mechanical Engineering alumnus who graduated in 2023, his internship in Shanghai was more than that—it was a transformative journey of growth, independence, and adaptability. And it all started with winning the prestigious\nSingapore Valley Awards\n(SVA) 2024.\nAbout the Award\nThe SVA challenges applicants to craft compelling business plans and brand narratives to impress a panel of esteemed judges. These judges, drawn from venture capital firms, and the tech industry, evaluate applicants during an intensive pitch session.\nOpen to full-time undergraduates from Singapore’s six autonomous universities, the winners – one selected from each university – receive the coveted Singapore Valley Award, a $2,000 cash prize and a prestigious overseas internship experience in a Chinese tech firm, with internship expenses covered by Enterprise Singapore Global Ready Talent Programme. SVA is supported by Tembusu Partners, a Singapore-based private equity firm which believes in fostering entrepreneurial talent and providing young Singaporeans with exposure to China's dynamic business landscape.\n“I participated in SVA to get one step closer to my ambition of being a robotics or tech entrepreneur,” James shared. Recognising it as a unique opportunity to gain exposure to China's vibrant tech landscape, James knew this was a chance to push himself beyond his comfort zone.\nThe Path to Winning\nIt was not an easy win for James. It began with a short questionnaire where James had to explain his business idea. For over a week, he worked on a detailed presentation deck to pitch his concept—an innovative idea for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) robotics aimed at addressing challenges in Singapore’s manufacturing industry, particularly in high mix-low volume tasks that conventional robotics cannot easily manage.\n“I believe my submission stood out because it was both innovative and practical, solving a key problem in Singapore’s manufacturing sector,” James explained. During the pitch, he shared not only his business concept but also his desire for the internship experience. “I was willing to pause my engineering career to undergo this entrepreneurship experience, and I think that resonated with the judges,” he added.\nApplicants were assessed based on their ideas, pitch delivery, and personality. Winning the SVA wasn’t just an accolade for James—it was his ticket to CTP Parking, a company at the forefront of electronic parking solutions in China.\nJames spent 3 months in CTP Parking as an intern from June to August 2024. (Photo: James Ow)\nA Crash Course in Sales, Business, and Culture\nWhen James joined CTP Parking for his internship in June 2024, his role as a hardware engineer was clear. However, it didn’t take long for him to transition into sales and business development, a pivot that allowed him to engage directly with China’s fast-paced business environment. His workdays were divided into two segments: mornings dedicated to researching companies and startups, and afternoons spent at tech expos. Although the expos weren’t part of his job, James seized the opportunity to explore cutting-edge innovations and immerse himself in China’s technological advancements.\nJames with A/Prof Eugene Wong, Director of Programmes of SIT’s Engineering cluster, who introduced him to the Singapore Valley Awards. (Photo: James Ow)\n“I went to Shanghai to learn how business is done there. Observing investor presentations during board meetings gave me firsthand insights into how deals are made in one of the world’s most competitive markets,” he explained.\nThe experience, however, wasn’t without its challenges. With its mix of Chinese dialects and technical terms, the language barrier initially posed a hurdle. James added, “Tools like Google Translate helped me a lot in times like this!”\n“The education I received at SIT prepared me well for the challenges in Shanghai,” James noted. On his first day, he was able to grasp the design software and system architecture used in the company, thanks to his hands-on learning in SIT’s Mechanical Engineering programme. “This allowed me to provide value-added feedback and design insights immediately,” he said.\nNavigating Independence, A Fast-Paced Work Lifestyle and... An Overstayed Visa\nLiving alone in a foreign city also meant learning to be independent. From renting an apartment to managing his day-to-day affairs, James embraced the freedom and responsibility of living abroad.\n“I came to Shanghai alone, but I left with a network of friends,” James shared fondly, recalling the networking events he attended in the city. These events introduced him to other interns, with whom he explored Shanghai’s vibrant social scene—from gaming nights to a visit to Disneyland Shanghai.\nNewly made friends are part of James' biggest takeaways from his internship. (Photo: James Ow)\nJames’ experience extended beyond professional skills. The fast-paced working environment in Shanghai, where many companies operate on the intense 996 schedule (9am to 9pm, six days a week), was a culture shock. While CTP Parking followed regular hours, James observed the relentless drive of the locals. “People in Shanghai live and work at a speed I wasn’t used to,” he reflected. But instead of being overwhelmed, he learned to thrive in this environment, balancing work responsibilities with personal growth.\nNear the end of his internship in August, James overstayed his visa due to a misunderstanding about required permits. He got booked for overstaying! The incident led to a fine and a delayed return to Singapore. While it was stressful then, James saw it as a learning experience that added to the thrills of his Shanghai adventure.\nA Launchpad for Success\nUpon returning to Singapore, James secured a role as a robotics engineer at Temasek Polytechnic, where he focuses on sourcing and working with manufacturing clients. He credits his Shanghai experience for preparing him for the challenges of this role.\n“The combination of technical and business skills I gained in Shanghai made me stand out,” he said. The independence he developed abroad also gave him the confidence to excel in interviews and navigate complex work environments. For SIT students considering similar opportunities, James has some words of wisdom: “Be comfortable with the uncomfortable. Stepping out of your comfort zone is where the real learning begins.”\nTopics\nSITizen\nEngineering\nInnovation\nAlumni\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nThe Perfect Proposal: Bot Helps Researchers Write Better Pitches for Funding\nview\nNext\nNo Reservations: Committed to Grooming the Next Generation of Hoteliers\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences"
