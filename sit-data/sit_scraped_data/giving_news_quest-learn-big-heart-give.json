    "On a quest to learn, with a big heart to give",
    "Recipient of the 2024 Rotary Club of Bugis Junction (RCBJ) Commendation Award, Johannes Gan Dombrowski wears many hats, with a drive for community service and volunteerism.",
    "07 November 2024",
    "No day goes unfulfilled for third-year student Johannes Gan Dombrowski",
    ".",
    "His schedule is always fully packed. “I like to keep myself busy,” the SITIZEN-DNA Award honouree shares, listing his myriad activities.",
    "Balancing his studies in Electronics and Data Engineering, Johannes works part-time at SIT through the Student Work Scheme, where he has held multiple roles since August 2023. He has contributed as a Future Communications Translation Lab Student Helper, assisting with test-bedding 5G technology research; a Catalyst Makerspace Student Coach, managing its day-to-day operations; a Student Technical Assistant, handling various laboratory tasks; and a Peer Tutor. Beyond these, he actively engages in several leadership roles at SIT. He currently serves as Vice-President (Academics) of the Student Management Committee, Head of Outreach for SIT VIVA VOCE and President of the SIT Social Entrepreneur Club. As an appointed SITizen Ambassador, he represents the university at events, networking with Ministers and industry leaders.",
    "Johannes explains, on why he stays so busy:",
    "\"It's more for personal growth and to help others. The real value comes from learning and building connections with the research professors. The best way to learn is through hands-on work, which is why I pester my professors for more projects, more research roles.\"",
    "Yet even with these commitments, Johannes still finds time to give back to the community. Outside of school, he has been involved in community service, particularly with the Rotaract Club since 2019. Most recently, he served as the President of the Rotaract Club of Raffles City and also played a key role in the success of the 20th Asia Pacific Regional Rotaract Conference 2024 as part of its executive committee, collaborating with hotels and the Singapore Tourism Board to arrange accommodations for international guests.",
    "It is no wonder that this year, Johannes was also recognised with the Rotary Club of Bugis Junction (RCBJ) Commendation Award, given to students who had contributed significantly beyond academic studies to SIT or the community at large.",
    "Passion to help special needs children, vulnerable in society",
    "Johannes’ insatiable appetite for learning and his drive to give back to society stems from a deep-rooted appreciation for life and a love for volunteering. In Primary 5, his niece was diagnosed with Aicardi Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder where the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain is absent or underdeveloped. Patients with this condition have intellectual disabilities and often suffer from seizures. Moved by her condition, he decided to help special needs children like her. Since then, Johannes has been active in community service, frequently participating in projects with voluntary welfare organisations such as the Rainbow Centre, Red Cross Home for the Disabled and Bukit Batok Nursing Home.",
    "Currently, he is focused on launching Project Kamleang, a flagship programme he co-founded. The initiative aims to empower young girls in Cambodia to protect themselves from sex trafficking by providing them with critical vocational and first aid skills, enabling them to pursue education and employment.",
    "Amazingly, Johannes still manages to excel academically, even with these projects that he has taken on. Last year, he earned a spot on the Provost’s List Commendation, awarded to the top two per cent of his cohort. He also secured the Santa Monica Fund Scholarship, given his outstanding achievements both in and out of school.",
    "Johannes taking part in the Recognition of Excellence 2023 event as a banterer.",
    "Focussing on what truly matters",
    "The scholarship has allowed Johannes to focus on what truly matters. “I can do so much on the side and not worry too much about finances. At the start of university, I was working to pay back my parents. Now, I get to focus more on learning,” Johannes shares gratefully.",
    "Although his parents, both retirees, had set aside some money for his studies, Johannes chose to take a loan from them to self-finance his education. “Whatever I can take off from them now, is more for their retirement,” he says.",
    "On his future and aspirations, Johannes hopes to be a start-up founder and continue his volunteer work with the Rotary Club once his career stabilises. For now, he has secured a one-year internship at Rohde & Schwarz GmbH in Germany and aims to transition into a full-time position.",
    "Motivated to make a lasting difference",
    "An engineering enthusiast with a love for data analytics and visualisation, Johannes is particularly fascinated by how big data can be used to model predictions. “I see myself specialising in the in-between, where you need to understand both hardware and software. That’s why I am focusing on IoT sensors, where I can transform the physical into digital,” he explains.",
    "Johannes credits SIT’s ecosystem and the support he receives from RCBJ and the Santa Monica Fund, for helping him focus on achieving his goals and dreams.",
    "\"As I continue my journey of leadership and positive change, I am deeply inspired by the support these awards provide. I am committed to using it as motivation to make a lasting difference.\"",
    "Johannes (third from left) interacting with residents from Bukit Batok Nursing Home during a Chinese New Year Celebration event.",
