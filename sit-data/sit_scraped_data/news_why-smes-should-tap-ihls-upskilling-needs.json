    "Why SMEs Should Tap on IHLs for Upskilling Needs",
    "Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) offer a wealth of resources, such as Applied Research Centres (ARCs) and customised learning pathways for working adults.",
    "The panel discussion on “An Ecosystem Support for your Upskilling Journey” provided an overview of the support available for SMEs to upskill their employees in the volatile business landscape. (Photo: SkillsFuture Singapore)",
    "Findings from a business performance survey conducted by The Institute of Adult Learning Singapore reveal that companies that rank high in both business strategy and people strategy report the best business performance. Such companies have a high demand for training and broad skills development needs, a highly engaged workforce and are future-proofing.",
    "When it comes to measuring the return on investment of the skills development efforts led by SMEs, Robin Ngan, Director of",
    "SIT",
    "LEARN",
    ", the lifelong learning arm of the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), said solution-focused training, identifying key success measures and tapping on the IHL ecosystem are key determinants.",
    "“To design effective training programmes, consider how your employees would contribute to the bottom line of your company after receiving training.  It depends on whether you are looking at a quick win (e.g. a proof of concept) or a company-wide project that you are working on. You need to be very clear about identifying your success metrics and it is also about SMEs maximising the use of resources available to them and knowing what and how they can tap on the IHL ecosystem,” said Mr Ngan.",
    "He was speaking at a panel discussion on ''An Ecosystem Support for your Upskilling Journey\", held at the SkillsFuture Human Capital Conference on 21 August 2024.  Organised by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and supported by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), the conference held at the Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre marked the end of the six-week-long SkillsFuture Festival that kicked off on 9 July 2024.",
    "Other than Mr Ngan, the other panelists included by Mr Ang Yuit, President of the Association of Small & Medium Enterprises; Mr Thian Tai Chew, Executive Director, Human Capital Division, SBF; and Ms Claren Chang, Senior Vice President, Regional Midcap and SME Strategic Partnership & Sustainability, DBS.  Ms Xu Wenshan, Director of Enterprise Engagement Division, SSG, moderated the panel discussion.",
    "The panel touched on how GenAI and sustainability created an urgent need for SMEs to equip their workforce with the relevant skills, the challenges faced by SMEs in upskilling their workforce and how these needs could be addressed through an ecosystem approach.",
    "Tapping on the Ecosystem",
    "Mr Thian Tai Chew from SBF noted that SMEs often cited the lack of time and cost of training as their main hurdles.",
    "One way to overcome these challenges is to partner IHLs, which have several programmes and initiatives to support upskilling and lifelong learning. Mr Ngan cited Applied Research Centres (ARCs) based in autonomous universities and Centres of Innovation (COIs) based in the polytechnics as examples, which are aimed at improving the technical and innovation capabilities of firms.",
    "Developed in collaboration with the relevant IHLs, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and across different industries ranging from aquaculture to precision engineering, these ARCs and COIs provide SMEs with the technical expertise and facilities needed to innovate and scale in new growth areas. ARCs work closely with the lifelong learning units of the various IHLs to promote solution-focused training.",
    "In the panel discussion, Mr Robin Ngan pointed out that innovation is crucial for SMEs’ survival, and they should tap on the rich ecosystem for training their staff in a bid to improve staff retention. (Photo: SkillsFuture Singapore)",
    "Mr Ngan also cited ARCs within SIT that help firms save cost and value-add to their bottom line.  For example, the",
    "Energy Efficiency Technology Centre",
    "at SIT helps SMEs find ways to save energy and promote sustainability, said Mr Ngan.",
    "FoodPlant",
    ", Singapore’s first shared facility for small-batch food production jointly developed by JTC Corporation, ESG, and SIT, looks at new ways to innovate food production. SMEs can leverage FoodPlant’s facilities to explore new methods to innovate food solutions for the industry. Located at JTC Food Hub @ Senoko, FoodPlant currently supports over 70 SMEs.",
    "Relevant and Practical Training Programmes for SMEs",
    "Today, adult learners have many opportunities to upgrade themselves regardless of their entry point, from work-study diplomas offered at Institute of Technical Education (ITEs), specialist diplomas at polytechnics to flexible degree pathways offered at universities.",
    "For example, SIT’s",
    "Competency-based Stackable Micro-credential Pathway",
    "helps “close the loop” on adult learning by letting them acquire competencies in specific areas of work specialisation such as machine learning and cybersecurity, leading to a Specialist Certificate.",
    "Individuals can take three to four months to complete a micro-credential and they can continue to work towards a degree. The micro-credential is largely asynchronous and they can learn at their own pace which makes it suitable for working adults, said Mr Ngan.",
    "The",
    "National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning",
    "(NACE) set up in the various IHLs also offers on-the-job training blueprints, research opportunities, coaching and mentoring and workplace learning projects for the industry. Through the Queen Bee partnership between SMRT and SIT, about 700 workplace trainers benefitted from the coaching and mentoring programme. This effectively transforms the learning culture of the organisation, said Mr Ngan.",
    "“There is a really rich ecosystem, and we encourage everyone to explore upskilling opportunities at IHLs, including SIT,” he added.",
    "Ms Xu Wenshan wrapped up the discussion with a call for action: “Let’s develop and help our people grow, or else we’ll see them go.”",

(Photo: SkillsFuture Singapore)\nFindings from a business performance survey conducted by The Institute of Adult Learning Singapore reveal that companies that rank high in both business strategy and people strategy report the best business performance. Such companies have a high demand for training and broad skills development needs, a highly engaged workforce and are future-proofing.\nWhen it comes to measuring the return on investment of the skills development efforts led by SMEs, Robin Ngan, Director of\nSIT\nLEARN\n, the lifelong learning arm of the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), said solution-focused training, identifying key success measures and tapping on the IHL ecosystem are key determinants.\n“To design effective training programmes, consider how your employees would contribute to the bottom line of your company after receiving training.  It depends on whether you are looking at a quick win (e.g. a proof of concept) or a company-wide project that you are working on. You need to be very clear about identifying your success metrics and it is also about SMEs maximising the use of resources available to them and knowing what and how they can tap on the IHL ecosystem,” said Mr Ngan.\nHe was speaking at a panel discussion on ''An Ecosystem Support for your Upskilling Journey\", held at the SkillsFuture Human Capital Conference on 21 August 2024.  Organised by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and supported by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), the conference held at the Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre marked the end of the six-week-long SkillsFuture Festival that kicked off on 9 July 2024.\nOther than Mr Ngan, the other panelists included by Mr Ang Yuit, President of the Association of Small & Medium Enterprises; Mr Thian Tai Chew, Executive Director, Human Capital Division, SBF; and Ms Claren Chang, Senior Vice President, Regional Midcap and SME Strategic Partnership & Sustainability, DBS.  Ms Xu Wenshan, Director of Enterprise Engagement Division, SSG, moderated the panel discussion.\nThe panel touched on how GenAI and sustainability created an urgent need for SMEs to equip their workforce with the relevant skills, the challenges faced by SMEs in upskilling their workforce and how these needs could be addressed through an ecosystem approach.\nTapping on the Ecosystem\nMr Thian Tai Chew from SBF noted that SMEs often cited the lack of time and cost of training as their main hurdles.\nOne way to overcome these challenges is to partner IHLs, which have several programmes and initiatives to support upskilling and lifelong learning. Mr Ngan cited Applied Research Centres (ARCs) based in autonomous universities and Centres of Innovation (COIs) based in the polytechnics as examples, which are aimed at improving the technical and innovation capabilities of firms.\nDeveloped in collaboration with the relevant IHLs, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and across different industries ranging from aquaculture to precision engineering, these ARCs and COIs provide SMEs with the technical expertise and facilities needed to innovate and scale in new growth areas. ARCs work closely with the lifelong learning units of the various IHLs to promote solution-focused training.\nIn the panel discussion, Mr Robin Ngan pointed out that innovation is crucial for SMEs’ survival, and they should tap on the rich ecosystem for training their staff in a bid to improve staff retention. (Photo: SkillsFuture Singapore)\nMr Ngan also cited ARCs within SIT that help firms save cost and value-add to their bottom line.  For example, the\nEnergy Efficiency Technology Centre\nat SIT helps SMEs find ways to save energy and promote sustainability, said Mr Ngan.\nFoodPlant\n, Singapore’s first shared facility for small-batch food production jointly developed by JTC Corporation, ESG, and SIT, looks at new ways to innovate food production. SMEs can leverage FoodPlant’s facilities to explore new methods to innovate food solutions for the industry. Located at JTC Food Hub @ Senoko, FoodPlant currently supports over 70 SMEs.\nRelevant and Practical Training Programmes for SMEs\nToday, adult learners have many opportunities to upgrade themselves regardless of their entry point, from work-study diplomas offered at Institute of Technical Education (ITEs), specialist diplomas at polytechnics to flexible degree pathways offered at universities.\nFor example, SIT’s\nCompetency-based Stackable Micro-credential Pathway\nhelps “close the loop” on adult learning by letting them acquire competencies in specific areas of work specialisation such as machine learning and cybersecurity, leading to a Specialist Certificate.\nIndividuals can take three to four months to complete a micro-credential and they can continue to work towards a degree. The micro-credential is largely asynchronous and they can learn at their own pace which makes it suitable for working adults, said Mr Ngan.\nThe\nNational Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning\n(NACE) set up in the various IHLs also offers on-the-job training blueprints, research opportunities, coaching and mentoring and workplace learning projects for the industry. Through the Queen Bee partnership between SMRT and SIT, about 700 workplace trainers benefitted from the coaching and mentoring programme. This effectively transforms the learning culture of the organisation, said Mr Ngan.\n“There is a really rich ecosystem, and we encourage everyone to explore upskilling opportunities at IHLs, including SIT,” he added.\nMs Xu Wenshan wrapped up the discussion with a call for action: “Let’s develop and help our people grow, or else we’ll see them go.”\nTopics\nCompetency-based Education\nFoodPlant\nApplied Research\nNACE\nSITLEARN\nSkillsFuture\nCATEGORIES\nIndustry & Community\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nBuilding a Sustainable Future One Beam at a Time\nview\nNext\nSIT Awards New Transcripts to Recognise Graduates’ Transferable Skills\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n20 May 2025\nFighting Fire with Knowledge\nWith a wealth of expertise in fire safety regulations, Principal Professional Officer Christopher Tan has designed a new postgraduate programme that aims to equip adult learners with fire safety knowledge and fire prevention skills.\ntag\nIndustry & Community\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
