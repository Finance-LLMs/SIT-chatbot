    "ProScreen: Automated Protein Profiling and Functional Characterisation Platform",
    "Join us in establishing Singapore’s first automated protein screening and functional characterisation platform.",
    "With industry concerns on allergenicity, inferior digestibility, poor functional properties of novel proteins and a limited pool of existing protein sources, ProScreen will enable the discovery of novel proteins of desirable properties for food product formulation by screening for the best candidates. The platform is also able to screen and unlock greater usage potential of existing proteins.",
    "ProScreen is a joint research programme between the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), National University of Singapore (NUS), Massey University and the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).",
    "Supporting Singapore's \"30 by 30\" goal",
    "The Singapore Food Story (SFS) aims to strengthen Singapore’s food security, which is vulnerable to emerging trends like increased global demand for food and climate change due to the lack of primary production in the nation. The “30 by 30” goal is to achieve production of 30% of the nation’s nutritional needs locally by 2030.",
    "To meet this goal, the SFS R&D Programme, led by A*STAR and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), was initiated to support the national agenda of strengthening Singapore’s food security. The Programme also bolsters the nation’s economy through the development of innovative and sustainable technologies for agriculture and aquaculture, as well as new biotech-based foods and ingredients, underpinned by a robust future-ready food safety system.",
    "ProScreen is funded by the SFS R&D Programme to deliver the following outcomes:",
    "1. Set up an automated protein profiling and characterisation process",
    "Developing Singapore’s first automated protein profiling and functional characterisation platform with improved throughput of testing",
    "2. Develop a green and scalable protein extraction and fractionation process",
    "Designing a conceptual pilot plant with life-cycle analysis to examine the sustainability impact of large-scale extraction and fractionation, with efficient usage of water and energy and minimise waste.",
    "3. Create an alternative protein database",
