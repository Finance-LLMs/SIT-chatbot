    "In fact, Shun Li is the first alumnus to have fully utilised his credits, putting them to good use to advance his role as a process engineer at Croda Singapore. His responsibilities in process safety; safety, health and environment; and plant upgrading amongst others, require him to constantly acquire new knowledge and competence in these fields.",
    "Shun Li is the first SIT alumnus to have fully utilised his $2,000 worth of SITizens Learning Credits.",
    "“I decided to sign up for a workshop at SIT. While applying, I discovered that as an SIT alumnus, I am eligible to use my SITizens Learning Credits. So, I proceeded to sign up for a series of workshops structured towards process safety essentials of a chemical plant,” said Shun Li.",

    "Like many others, Shun Li was initially uncertain about how applicable the courses would be. He later realised that his worry was unfounded.",
    "“The Process Safety workshop covered both theoretical and practical aspects, providing me with important fundamentals to review and carry out tasks related to each module. Furthermore, I am now able to better understand discussions during process safety meetings and share my knowledge with fellow engineers and operators,” he shared.",
    "“Besides the course content, I also had the opportunity to learn from fellow course mates who have vast experience in process safety and exchange knowledge on industrial insights with them,” he added.",
    "Shun Li is just one of many success stories that have demonstrated the difference lifelong learning can make to a professional career. In Shun Li’s words, “Never forget the SIT-DNA of 'Able to Learn, Unlearn and Relearn'. The world is ever-evolving and we have to be adaptable to changes to stay on top. Don’t stop learning, and start taking up courses to deepen your knowledge to stay competent.”",
    "Come 2023, SIT will move to the Punggol Digital District that incorporates a business park. The proximity will open up greater opportunities for SIT to collaborate with the industry and pave the way for working professionals to stay adaptive, relevant and nimble – through lifelong learning.",

Don’t stop learning, and start taking up courses to deepen your knowledge to stay competent.”\nCome 2023, SIT will move to the Punggol Digital District that incorporates a business park. The proximity will open up greater opportunities for SIT to collaborate with the industry and pave the way for working professionals to stay adaptive, relevant and nimble – through lifelong learning.\nLearn more\nabout the\nwide array of courses\nat SIT\nLEARN\n.\nThis article was adapted from The Singapore Engineers December 2019 publication with the permission of The Institution of Engineers, Singapore.\nThe\nProcess Safety Workshop series\nconducted, by SIT\nLEARN\n, is specially designed to help people tasked with safety responsibilities, gain the engineering and management expertise needed to safely operate a plant in Singapore.
