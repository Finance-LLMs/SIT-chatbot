Not only\ndo I get to be seen and heard by the SIT\ncommunity, it also makes me proud to tell\nothers that I am studying in an institution\nthat I truly care about. The SIT Scholarship\ngives me a new purpose in my university life\nas it allows me to expand my perspective\nbeyond academics.\nI am encouraged to actively contribute and\nmake a difference in the SIT community by\nserving as the President of the Astronomy\nclub. Opportunities like this add excitement\nto my university experience.\nWith multiple opportunities such as the\nScholarship Engagement Programme (SEP),\nI was able to network and connect with\nlike-minded individuals across different\nfaculties. SEP not only helped me improve\nmy social skills, but also provided me with\nthe necessary knowledge and skills set,\npreparing me to be a future leader. This\nmotivates me to work harder as an SIT\nscholar to realise my best potential.\nAny words of advice for your juniors?\nUniversity education is definitely not a walk\nin the park. It’s all right to fall. As long as you\ncan pick yourself up and be consistent, your\nefforts will shine through. Most importantly,\nalways remember to take care of your health\nduring your education journey!BUSINESS,\nCOMMUNICATION\nAND DESIGN\nSINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\n07\nLEE SHAO YONG\nYear 3\nMechanical Design and Manufacturing\nEngineering\nWhat does being an SIT Scholar\nmean to you?\nHaving been awarded the SIT Mid-Term\nScholarship, I hope to be an inspiration to\nmany others, particularly those coming from\nITE. Many people believe that ITE students\ncannot compete academically with those\nwho take a conventional path to university.\nHowever, as an ITE graduate, I can attest to\nthe contrary. All educational paths progress\ntowards an individual’s future, and it is up to\nyou to believe that success is attainable.\nI always remind myself that the decisions I\nmake now will shape my future. By striving\nto work hard, asking questions, and ensuring\nthat I spend enough time revising and\nunderstanding, I can achieve what I never\nthought I could during my studies at ITE.\nAs an SIT scholar, I hope to serve as an\nexample to ITE students and their parents. It\nis possible to succeed in university, despite\ntaking a longer academic path. It all begins\nwith intrinsic motivation and a positive\nmindset to reach your goal.\nI’ve had the opportunity to learn more about\nmyself and various types of personalities\nthanks to the Scholarship Engagement\nProgramme (SEP). As a result, I am able to\nunderstand the different teammates that I\nworked with, and leverage their strengths to\nachieve our desired objectives.\nAny words of advice for your juniors?\nDon’t just dream or hope, work hard, and\nachieve it.ENGINEERING\nSCHOLARSHIPS & FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 2023\n08\nBRICE LIM\nFinal Year\nFood Technology\nWhat does being an SIT Scholar\nmean to you?\nBecoming an SIT scholar came as an\nunexpected blessing. It has given me the\nopportunity to make the most out of my\nuniversity life, maximise my learning, and have\nthe freedom to give back to the community.\nThe Scholarship Engagement Programme\n(SEP) has provided me with the opportunity\nto engage with like-minded individuals and\nbroaden my horizons. I am looking forward\nto participating in the curated activities\nand expanding my university experience\nbeyond academics. SEP provided me with\nthe opportunity to hone my leadership and\ncommunication skills, which will be vital in\nmaximising my ability to give back to my peers.\nThrough my journey, I hope to inspire\nothers to believe that they, too, are\ncapable of doing the same and achieving\ntheir full potential.\nAny words of advice for your juniors?\nDon’t be afraid to step into unfamiliar\nterritory and expand your horizons. For\nmany of us, this may be the last stage of\nour educational journey.

It is an entrustment\nthat those in the role will contribute and\nempower fellow SITizens to achieve the\nunachievable. As an SIT scholar, I hope to\nmake a difference in the community and\ninspire my peers to do the same!\nI would say that the most valuable takeaway\nfrom my SIT scholarship experience has\nbeen the varied opportunities provided\nfor the development of my interpersonal\nand leadership skills. The Scholarship\nEngagement Programme recently hosted\nnetworking events for fellow like-minded\npeers and alumni. Opportunities such as\nThe Ambassador Platform has also given\nme a chance to represent the University,\nreach out and connect with prospective\njuniors.\nAny words of advice for your juniors?\nI guess the main piece of advice to my\njuniors revolves around one of my favourite\nquotes by Herman Hesse: “Learn what is to\nbe taken seriously and laugh at the rest.”\nThis quote reflects my work ethic as well\nas the way I view my university experience.\nWhile it is of great importance to focus\non academics, it is of equal importance\nto surround yourself with like-minded and\nsupportive people, and to do the things\nyou’re passionate about. Afterall, humour\nand fun-filled experiences are what brings\nspice to university life and keeps you going!HEALTH AND\nSOCIAL\nSCIENCES\nSCHOLARSHIPS & FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 2023\n10\nCALEB KIAN LOY\nYear 2\nUser Experience and Game Design\nWhat does being an SIT Scholar\nmean to you?\nI love game design and see games as\na medium of expression through which\nI can connect with others. In previous\nvolunteering work, I’ve been able to use\ngames to bring communities together,\nproviding a space where people can\nplay and bond with each other, and have\neven been able to teach underprivileged\nyouths to design their own games. The SIT\nScholarship is an invaluable opportunity\nthat allows me to focus on my studies and\npursue this passion\nAny words of advice for your juniors?\nThrough your university education at SIT,\nyour path and life in general will be different\nfrom those around you. Forge your own\npath and go at your own pace. My favourite\nquote is:\n“You cannot, you cannot use someone\nelse’s fire. You can only use your own.\nAnd in order to do that, you must first\nbe willing to believe that you have it.”\n– Audre LordeINFOCOMM\nTECHNOLOGY\nSINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\n11\nAs Singapore’s University of Applied Learning, SIT views\nour scholars as proactive agents of innovation and\ntransformation.
