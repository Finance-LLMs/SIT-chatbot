While making herself available for consultation, Karin views herself as a facilitator to empower students to take responsibility for their own learning. Karin has also been the champion pioneer in Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) at SIT. She has piloted several different tools that have been proven to not only be effective  in teaching the students but also assist  faculty in their teaching. Karin actively shares and encourages her peers in adopting TEL tools to enhance the quality of teaching and learning at SIT.\n(Abstract from citation by ICT Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Kyrin Liong\nAssistant Professor Kyrin Liong centres her teaching on three basic principles. To facilitate inductive learning, creating an active learning environment and to encourage growth mindsets in her students. While her primary approach to teaching is to enable students with the skills to appreciate and assimilate current knowledge and combine them with new ideas to innovate, the true core of her teaching philosophy rests on building a strong student-teacher relationship. Kyrin has also been innovative in her teaching approaches, using new technologies such as holograms in mixed reality to not only excite her students in their learning, but more importantly, to achieve the intended learning outcomes.\n(Abstract from citation by ENG Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Lim Bee Gim\nAssociate Professor Lim Bee Gim is passionate and dedicated about sharing her industrial experience and knowledge with her students. She strives for all her students to independently find solutions to problems they encounter and is committed to guiding her students towards this goal. Bee Gim also nurtures her students by providing a constant source of encouragement and support both inside and outside the classroom.\n(Abstract from citation by CEFT Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr May Lim\nMay is an Associate Professor at the Singapore Institute of Technology and the Director of Centre for Learning Environment and Assessment Development (CoLEAD) that looks after the faculty development programmes in learning and teaching at the university level.\nMay plays a key role in shaping and sharing education policies such as Teaching & Learning policy, Assessment Policy and Academic Integrity Policy.\nMay is also an experienced occupational therapist by profession and she previously led the Bachelor of Science (with Honours) in Occupational Therapy degree at SIT.
