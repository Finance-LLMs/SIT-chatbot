    "Company Applied Research Design Studio (CARDS) is an applied learning and research module set up to explore specific challenges of a company while simultaneously training the individual participant with design innovation skills.",
    "In the CARDS, a company sends teams of individuals to tackle early stage challenges that must find the intricate balance between user desirability, business viability, and technological feasibility. The company sending participants can sponsor challenge areas with a lightly defined problem area. Subsequently, the problem area will be analysed in order to arrive at a more defined problem question. This problem question will be explored during the course of the programme. This method avoids the incessant pitfall of having predefined solutions look for poorly defined problems. In this course, solutions are often omni-channel and multi-faceted. Solutions will focus on the cyclical experience of stakeholders, users or customers. These applied solutions may be, but are not limited to, business models, immersive spatial environments, digital interfaces, etc.",
    "For self-sponsorship individuals, there may be special arrangements, where feasible to tie up with the industry to work on company specific challenges. An example is Crown Coffee, whereby there could be several innovation projects for an authentic learning experience.",
    "Throughout the 12 contact days over a period of 3 months, additional modules that complement the CARDS will be offered concurrently. On one hand, the CARDS is applied learning such that principles, frameworks and theories must be applied to an actual company’s context and situation through reiterative refinement. On the other hand, the CARDS is applied research as the problems tackled are deemed crucial by the company and the solutions are practical, specific, effective and valuable for the company. The results of the project may lead to a case study.",
    "Through multiple consultations with various experts, the innovation project team will triangulate to a series of solutions. At the end of the course, a final presentation will be made to the companies. The company sponsor may co-grade the module.",
    "Who Should Attend",
    "Professionals, Managers, Senior Executives who wish to enhance their design innovation in their company and strengthen their ability to lead in a digitally",
    "Leaders seeking to learn new problem-solving approaches to innovation and integrate creative practices into their business processes",
    "Individuals who do not have a project team or a project topic. These participants would be assigned to a company that has a range of innovation topics",
    "Individuals who are attending as a team but have yet to define a project topic. These participants would be assigned to a company that has a range of innovation topics",
    "Teams of 2-3 with a sponsored project topic (but not necessarily a fully defined project brief). Projects must have a project sponsor who is not a member of the team",
    "Prerequisites",
    "Candidates should possess a Bachelor degree in any discipline",
    "Candidates without a Bachelor degree can be admitted on a case-by-case basis upon evaluation by the course director",
    "What You Will Learn",
    "Most importantly, you will learn how to think fast and slow, big and small, short and long terms simultaneously. With this mindset, you would triangulate to solutions for a problem worth solving. The problem questions itself would be constantly improved. The iterative Design Strategy and Innovation (DSI) cycles will refine the project",
    "Design-wise, you will ideate in a disciplined manner and communicate these ideas via various forms of low to mid resolution solutions. Multiple methods to break out of the creative mental blocks would be shared. A cadence of coming up with design possibilities would be established in a design studio like environment",
    "Strategy-wise, you will consider multiple stakeholder networks and how to customise business strategies. However, these strategies would not be imagined in isolation without the input of those involved in execution and decision making. Ideas would push against reality. Consequences would be drawn out through crafted scenarios",
    "Business-wise, you will break down the principles and success of what makes various process, product and experiences so apropos for today and tomorrow’s conditions. Exercises will include, but not be limited to, identifying $0 solutions and cross-industry opportunities",
    "Technology-wise, you will consider the social construction of technology and how various end-user psychology impacts the adoption of project’s choice of technology or technologies. You will understand how technology should not be seen merely as an isolated product but as a platform and system that affects human experience and touchpoints",
