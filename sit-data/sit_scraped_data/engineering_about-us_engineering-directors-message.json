We have professional engineers, chartered engineers, certified and licensed engineers affiliated with various professional engineering bodies in both public and private sectors in our midst. For example, some of us are certified under the Singapore Certified Energy Manager (SCEM) programme of the National Environment Agency and are active in conducting energy efficiency assessments for industry with our students, while others write textbooks capturing their rich industry experience for teaching in universities around the world.",
    "Most of our faculty members have doctorate degrees and are active in industry-facing applied research and innovation activities, producing solutions that make our research impact felt through industry and community transformation. Examples include new construction materials and methods to reduce our dependency on labour in the construction sector, and new electricity distribution architecture to accommodate higher adoption of solar photovoltaic power generation.",
    "Above all, we are enthusiastic educators who love to teach what we professionally practise to our students and prepare them for their future careers in the engineering world. We bring our industry experience into the classrooms and laboratories through authentic teaching and assessment. We bring our latest applied research outcomes with industry into our curriculum so that our graduates are well-equipped to handle future emerging technologies.",
    "As we also strongly believe in lifelong learning, we continue to engage our graduates through applied research collaboration with their employers, and through continuing education and training (CET) in our postgraduate programmes and short courses.
