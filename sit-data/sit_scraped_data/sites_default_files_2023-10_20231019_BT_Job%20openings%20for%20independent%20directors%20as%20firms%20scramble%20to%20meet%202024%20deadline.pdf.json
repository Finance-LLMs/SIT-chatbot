This is\nto comply with a new nine-year\ntenure limit set by the Singapore\nExchange Regulation (SGX RegCo).\nWhile the proportion of long-\nserving independent directors\nhas gone down in 2022 compared\nwith 24.6 per cent in 2020, there is\nstill a significant number who will\nbe affected by the new ruling. It\nhas already come into effect,\nthough the regulator has allowed\nthose who have already exceeded\nthe term limit to continue to be\nconsidered independent until the\ncompany’s AGM is held for the fi-\nnancial year ending on or after\nDec 31, 2023.\nAmong companies that have\nbeen listed for more than nine\nyears, the proportion of long-\nserving independent directors is\neven higher at 24.9 per cent,\nbased on the latest Singapore Di-\nrectorship Report released by the\nSingapore Institute of Directors\n(SID) on W ednesday (Oct 18).\n“That means one-quarter of\nyour independent directors in\ncompanies that are listed for more\nthan nine years – that pool will\nhave to turn over ,” said Singapore\nInstitute of T echnology account-\ning professor Ho Y ew Kee, who\npresented the findings of the re-\nport on W ednesday .\n“So this is one of the early warn-\ning signals that we need to send\nbasically to all the companies –\nyou have to start looking at yoursuccession plan, because come\nnext year ... everyone will be\nscrambling to look for an inde-\npendent director . Alternatively ,\nyou can do musical chairs,” added\nProf Ho.\nThe report, which is typically\npublished once every two years,\nreviews the state of directorship\nin Singapore. The 2023 report – its\nfifth edition – examined the cor-\nporate filings and annual reports\nfor the financial year ended on\nDec 31, 2022, of 650 companies\nlisted on the SGX.\nBesides data on board tenures,\nthe report also found that the lev-\nel of disclosures of directors’ and\nchief executives’ remuneration\nhave not changed much since the\n2021 report.\nThe latest report showed that\n37.5 per cent of all SGX-listed\ncompanies made detailed disclo-\nsures on remuneration as well as\nin bands, a slight decline from\n38.3 per cent previously .\nListed companies performed\neven worse in disclosing the re-\nmuneration of their chief execu-\ntive officers in detail.\nOut of 439 CEOs who are also\ncompany directors, the study\nfound that only 25.5 per cent of\ncompanies had detailed disclo-\nsures of their CEO’s remunera-\ntion. Close to 60 per cent of com-\npanies disclosed their CEO’s re-\nmuneration in bands.\nGiven the lack of progress in re-\nmuneration disclosures, V ictor\nY eo, associate professor of busi-\nness law at Nanyang T echnologi-\ncal University’s business school,\nsaid it is timely that SGX RegCo is\nmaking remuneration disclosures\nmandatory .\n“Disclosure is still a major is-\nsue, and we can understand why ,\nafter so many years of cajoling,\npushing, encouraging and sayingthis is good, we have now come to\nthe stage where it is going to be\nmade mandatory for directors\nand CEOs,” said Prof Y eo, who also\npresented the findings on\nW ednesday .\nFollowing a public consultation\nin October last year , SGX RegCo\nmade the decision to mandate\nthat listed companies disclose the\nexact amount and breakdown of\nthe remuneration paid to their CE-\nOs and directors in their annual\nreports for the financial years\nending on or after Dec 31, 2024.\nThe frontline regulator also re-\nmoved the two-tier vote mecha-\nnism that allows companies to re-\ntain long-serving independent di-\nrectors who have served for more\nthan nine years. This effectively\ncurbs their term limit, as they\nwould have to be redesignated as\nnon-independent directors if they\nchoose to remain on the board af-\nter nine years.\nThe two-tier system requiredthose serving more than nine\nyears to surrender their indepen-\ndent status unless they are ap-\nproved through two tiers of vot-\ning.\nSharing the rationale behind\nthe removal of the two-tier sys-\ntem, SGX RegCo’s head of listing\ncompliance June Sim, who spoke\nat a panel discussion at the re-\nport’s launch, said there were still\n239 issuers with long-serving in-\ndependent directors on their\nboards in 2022 – a number which\nshe said was “quite glaring”.\nWhen she checked the data on\nW ednesday , that figure had not\nimproved, as directors have been\ntaking advantage of the two-tier\nvote mechanism.\nShe also noted that there are 43\ncompanies with three or more\nlong-serving independent direc-\ntors, out of which 38 are small-cap\ncompanies and mainly listed on\nthe Catalist board.\n“So for small-cap companies,it’s going to be a mad rush. As reg-\nulators, we will engage their spon-\nsors to make sure that these Cata-\nlist-issuers take action now ,” she\nsaid.\nSGX RegCo’s chief executive of-\nficer T an Boon Gin said that nomi-\nnating committees of companies’\nboards need to step up their suc-\ncession planning and take into ac-\ncount the requirements on board\ndiversity .\nWhile female directors made\nup almost 25 per cent of indepen-\ndent director appointments since\nboard diversity disclosures were\nmandated in 2022, a figure which\nT an said is encouraging, he added\nthat more needs to be done in\nview of the many seats soon to be\nup for renewal.\nAs for companies’ hesitancy in\ndisclosing remuneration, Prof Y eo\nhighlighted that the oft-cited rea-\nsons are the fear of poaching and\npotential escalation of directors’\nand CEOs’ salaries.\nWhile Prof Ho said these con-\ncerns are legitimate, mandatory\ndisclosures improve transparen-\ncy , openness and trust. T o guard\nagainst potential implications\nonce remuneration is made pub-\nlic, such as unhappiness over sal-\nary discrepancies between em-\nployees and CEOs as well as direc-\ntors, he said companies need to be\nable to defend the level of com-\npensation they are offering to the\nboard and management.\nIn fact, Sim said companies list-\ned here have benefited from the\n“very , very slow progress” on re-\nmuneration disclosures.\n“Other markets are looking at\ndisclosures of clawback arrange-\nments and penalties. And here,\nour Singapore companies are still\nresting on their laurels in terms of\nnot disclosing remuneration,” she\nadded.Jobopeningsforindependentdirectors\nasfirmsscrambletomeet2024deadline\nSome 462 directors may have to leave or surrender their independent status to comply with a new nine-year tenure limit set by SGX\nBy Janice Lim\njanicelim@sph.com.sg\nThe latest Singapore Directorship Report shows that 37.5 per cent of all\nSGX-listed companies made detailed disclosures on remuneration as\nwell as in bands, a slight decline from 38.3 per cent previously.\nPHOTO: HENG YIN YIN, ZB\nPublication: The Business Times\nDate: 19 Oct 2023\nHeadline: Job openings for independent\ndirectors as firms scramble to meet 2024\ndeadline\nSource: The Business Times © SPH Media Limited.
