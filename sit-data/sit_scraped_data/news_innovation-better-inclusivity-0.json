    "Innovation for Better Inclusivity",
    "The 'FoodFriend' project aims to bring about a better dining experience for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (PWIDs).",
    "The winning team from SIT with Education Minister Chan Chun Sing and representatives from Dell Technologies and MINDS (Photo: Dell Technologies)",
    "In a remarkable display of innovation and inclusivity, Team Pathmakers, comprising Year 3",
    "Computing Science",
    "students Dylan Tok, Xu Xueli, Yong Kai En, Zhang XiangHui, Samantha Lee and Ryan Sim, emerged victorious at the InnovateFest 2023, hosted by Dell Technologies. Their creation, ‘FoodFriend’, promises to revolutionise the dining experience for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (PWIDs).",
    "The team spent two months designing the concept, developing a prototype, running user tests and working on iteration improvements. Their hard work paid off as they emerged champions, netting a $10,000 cash prize.",
    "Dell Technologies and the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) identified problem statements that challenged university students to present innovative ways to improve PWIDs’ access to community spaces in the F&B sector and foster more inclusivity.",
    "During the competition, participants were invited to build their solutions on a platform hosted by Dell Technologies. Each team’s solution had to incorporate emerging technologies such as cloud-native, extended reality and AI Machine Learning, with guidance and mentorship from Dell Technologies, MINDS and other organisations.",
    "FoodFriend: The Bridge to Inclusivity",
    "Team Pathmakers, led by Dylan, came up with the proposal for a mobile application ‘FoodFriend’. At the heart of FoodFriend is the commitment to making hawker centres more accessible for PWIDs. The app provides personalised, step-by-step, and visual guidance on how to communicate their food preferences to the vendor and pay for meals effortlessly. By eliminating confusion and reducing barriers, FoodFriend empowers PWIDs to enjoy dining out independently.",
    "Some features of FoodFriend include:",
    "1. Accessibility-focused menus via QR code scanning, supported by step-by-step ordering flow to prevent communication barriers between users and stall owners",
    "2. Built-in calculator that calculates the amount to pay and change to expect",
    "3. Multi-language support, including English, Chinese, Bahasa Melayu and Tamil",
    "4. Instant audio guidance for assistance",
    "5. Allergy and dietary preferences",
    "6. Discovery of nearby and recommended stalls tailored to suit one’s taste and location",
    "7. Integration of Google Maps to allow users to get to the food locations easily",
    "Mobile interface of FoodFriend",
    "\"When we first started this project, we never imagined the impact it would have,” said Dylan. “The beauty of technology is that it can break down barriers. We're thrilled to be part of a movement using innovation to promote social inclusion and empower PWIDs. Knowing that PWIDs can confidently navigate, order, and pay for their meals independently, we feel we've made a real difference.”",
    "InnovateFest 2023 also saw another team from SIT, comprising Year 3 Computing Science students Esther Tan, Fathima Raeesah, Lau Hui Qi, Leong Weng Yan Ivan, Ng Shi Ying Nicole and Tan Xin Jie, who received consolation prize.",
    "Another team of SIT students proposed a mobile app that incorporates audio-based learning.  (Photo: Dell Technologies)",
    "Their proposal, ‘Nom Nom Buddy’, is a mobile application with audio-based learning. Users will select their preferred dish from a photo-based menu, customise their dish, listen to how their order sounds through text-to-speech technology, and learn to speak the orders themselves. It aims to empower PWIDs to order their own meals and reduce reliance on caregivers.",
    "“By involving local hawkers and stall owners in this initiative, we’re promoting a more inclusive and understanding society,” said Fathima. “It’s a small step towards a brighter future.”",

Their creation, ‘FoodFriend’, promises to revolutionise the dining experience for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (PWIDs).\nThe team spent two months designing the concept, developing a prototype, running user tests and working on iteration improvements. Their hard work paid off as they emerged champions, netting a $10,000 cash prize.\nDell Technologies and the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) identified problem statements that challenged university students to present innovative ways to improve PWIDs’ access to community spaces in the F&B sector and foster more inclusivity.\nDuring the competition, participants were invited to build their solutions on a platform hosted by Dell Technologies. Each team’s solution had to incorporate emerging technologies such as cloud-native, extended reality and AI Machine Learning, with guidance and mentorship from Dell Technologies, MINDS and other organisations.\nFoodFriend: The Bridge to Inclusivity\nTeam Pathmakers, led by Dylan, came up with the proposal for a mobile application ‘FoodFriend’. At the heart of FoodFriend is the commitment to making hawker centres more accessible for PWIDs. The app provides personalised, step-by-step, and visual guidance on how to communicate their food preferences to the vendor and pay for meals effortlessly. By eliminating confusion and reducing barriers, FoodFriend empowers PWIDs to enjoy dining out independently.\nSome features of FoodFriend include:\n1. Accessibility-focused menus via QR code scanning, supported by step-by-step ordering flow to prevent communication barriers between users and stall owners\n2. Built-in calculator that calculates the amount to pay and change to expect\n3. Multi-language support, including English, Chinese, Bahasa Melayu and Tamil\n4. Instant audio guidance for assistance\n5. Allergy and dietary preferences\n6. Discovery of nearby and recommended stalls tailored to suit one’s taste and location\n7. Integration of Google Maps to allow users to get to the food locations easily\nMobile interface of FoodFriend\n\"When we first started this project, we never imagined the impact it would have,” said Dylan. “The beauty of technology is that it can break down barriers. We're thrilled to be part of a movement using innovation to promote social inclusion and empower PWIDs. Knowing that PWIDs can confidently navigate, order, and pay for their meals independently, we feel we've made a real difference.”\nInnovateFest 2023 also saw another team from SIT, comprising Year 3 Computing Science students Esther Tan, Fathima Raeesah, Lau Hui Qi, Leong Weng Yan Ivan, Ng Shi Ying Nicole and Tan Xin Jie, who received consolation prize.\nAnother team of SIT students proposed a mobile app that incorporates audio-based learning.  (Photo: Dell Technologies)\nTheir proposal, ‘Nom Nom Buddy’, is a mobile application with audio-based learning. Users will select their preferred dish from a photo-based menu, customise their dish, listen to how their order sounds through text-to-speech technology, and learn to speak the orders themselves. It aims to empower PWIDs to order their own meals and reduce reliance on caregivers.\n“By involving local hawkers and stall owners in this initiative, we’re promoting a more inclusive and understanding society,” said Fathima. “It’s a small step towards a brighter future.”\nTopics\nComputing Science\nSITizens\nApplied Learning\nCATEGORIES\nSITizens & Campus\nInfocomm Technology\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nRedefining Prawn Noodles: The Road Less Travelled\nview\nNext\nClass of 2023: Impactful Projects Leading to Career Take-offs\nview\nRelated News\n23 May 2025\nGame On, One Code at a Time\nSIT-DigiPen alumnus Nico Wong’s dream career as a programmer in the gaming industry took root after winning the confidence of his supervisor and team members during his Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP).\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Industry & Community, Infocomm Technology\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences"
