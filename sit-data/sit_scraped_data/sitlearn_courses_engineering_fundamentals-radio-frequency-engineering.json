    "RF and wireless systems are one of the key enabling technologies for next-generation intelligent transportation systems (ITS), ranging from Vehicle to infrastructure (V2X) communication systems to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and satellite navigation systems.",
    "The RF/microwave electronics industry is evolving rapidly to meet the requirements of a variety of applications, leading to robust ITS. The electronics industries, as they evolve in this sector while adapting from the previous generation of digital electronics to advanced RF electronics, are having to equip their engineers with fundamental principles of RF and microwave engineering. This intermediate-level course aims to facilitate this transition for practising engineers by exposing them to the concepts in RF engineering essential for the design, fabrication, system integration, and testing of RF systems. The course introduces the fundamentals, enforcing the basic knowledge necessary for understanding operation and design principles in a typical RF system.",
    "Distributed effects in a transmission line and the transition from traditional voltage and current waves to power waves in the form of scattering parameters will be introduced. Techniques for impedance matching and visualising using the Smith chart will be covered. Transmission line types and effects critical for PCB design, especially for high-frequency operation, will be covered. Finally, essential topics on antennas, their radiation characteristics, and related propagation effects will be covered. The course will cover relevant examples using appropriate design and simulation tools, where applicable.",
    "To aid companies in transforming their capabilities through their human capital and support Singapore’s drive towards becoming a Smart Nation, this course is mapped to the Singapore Economic Development Board’s Singapore Smart Industry Readiness Index:",

    "Dr. Venkat specialises in Applied Electromagnetics and RF Engineering. He teaches Radio Frequency related course under the SITLEARN programme. He has over 15 years of academic and industrial research experience in the different areas around applied electromagnetics. Prior to joining SIT, he was with ST Electronics, working on solutions for Satellite Communications and Sensors. He was with EADS (currently Airbus) involved in various projects such as effects of antenna siting, interference suppression in Instrument Landing Systems, Reconfigurable antennas to name a few. He has previously, served as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at National University of Singapore (NUS) where he used to teach a graduate-level course on Electromagnetic Compatibility. He is a senior member of the IEEE. He holds one patent granted by Singapore IPOS and has over 40 international journal and peer-reviewed conference publications. He has served as the reviewer for many international journals and chaired sessions in conferences related to applied electromagnetics. He has co-authored a chapter titled “Application of Multi-objective Optimization Algorithms in Electromagnetic Design Problems\", in an edited book entitled “Real-World Multiobjective System Engineering”, published by Nova Science Publishers, NY, USA, Dec 2005. He holds a Bachelor of Engineering from the Anna University, India, a Master of Electrical Engineering from the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA and a Doctor of Philosophy from NUS, Singapore.",
