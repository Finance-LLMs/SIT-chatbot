Through a three-year endeavour, SrT and SP will locus on upskilling and reskilling  of SP's employees. Both\norganisations signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on 17 July 2022 at Energy Innovation 2022, organised by the Energy\nMarket Authority (EMA).\nAs Singapore  advances towards a sustainable energy future and its Smart Nation ambitions,  it is crucial that local  talents gain knowledge\nand skills to adapt and thrive in the evolving energy sector. To grow engineering talent pi1>eline and skillset for the energy sector, the SIT­\nSP partnership seeks to provide continuous skills upgrading pathways for SP employees through a full-time undergraduate degree\nin Electrical Power Engineering. Students will benefit from the Integrated Work Study Programme (rWSP) and Capstone Projects,\nwhich put theory into practice in real work situations. SIT and SP will provide students with workplace learning opportunities and\ninnovation projects that address emerging needs of the energy industry.\nSaid Professor Chua Kee Chalng, SIT President: \"This MOU underscores SIT's shared commitment with SP to upskill and reskill\ndifferent generations of power engineers, to cater to new industry demands.  As the demands of tomorrow continue to evolve, it calls for\ncloser academia-industry partners hips with industry leaders like SP, and a work-study approach to better train work-ready professionals.\nAs SIT continues to expand its footprint across industries to address these ever-changing needs, we welcome  like-minded partners to\njoin our efforts to upskill, res kill, and build the workforce of tomorrow.\"\nGroup Chief Executive Officer of SP Group, Stanley Huang, said, \"We are pleased to launch the work-study programme with SIT, to\nhelp our workers upskill and adapt to the changing energy landscape. It enables them to pursue an engineering degree course full-time,\nwhile continuing in work roles during the course of their study and applying the knowledge they gain. This is part of SP Group's\ncommitment to continuously develop our workforce for the needs of our industry and support our workers in contributing effectively.\"\nMr Ngiam Shih Chun, Chief Executive of EMA, said, \"As Singapore advances our energy transition towards a more sustainable future,\nwe will need to ensure that workers are equipped with relevant skillsets to take on new opportunities. EMA is supportive of such\nacademia-indust ry partnerships in building up Singapore's manpower capabilities for the energy sector. We are heartened to note SP\nGroup's strong emphasis and commitment on upskilling its employees. We hope this collaboration between SlT and SP Group will be the\nfirst of many such partnerships to come, to build a future-ready workforce that will propel Singapore's energy sector forward.\"\nAs a start, a pioneer cohort of SP employees will undertake a full-time three-year Electrical Power Engineering  (EPE) undergraduate\ndegree programme at SIT, starting in September 2022. The degree programme, jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University, is\nspecially customised to provide students with a holistic approach to learning while experiencing  hands-on industry-focused activities.\nAs part of this pio11eer cohort in September 2022, five SP employees will be onboarded as full-time students , where they will get to apply\nexisting practices from the workplace, and hone their skills through actual work exposure made possible by SIT's unique applied learning\npedagogy. SP will be sponsoring their studies as they pursue their career aspirations and grow their engineering capabilities.\nThis MOU is an extension of the ongoing partnership between SIT and SP over the past few years - which currently includes SP's\ninvestment in Singapore's  first experimental, multi-energy microgrid at SIT's future campus in the Punggol Digital District, signaling a\nlong-term commitment of both o rganisations' collective efforts to advance the energy sector in Singapore.\nFor the full press release, please go to SIT's Digital Newsroom.\nEducators Who Inspire a Growth\nMindset\n12 outstanding faculty members who have gone above and beyond their roles as educators have received the\nannual SIT Teaching Excellence Award for AY2020/21.

(Photo: SNOC/ Kelly Wong)\nAt the 31st Southeast Asian (SEA) Games this year, SIT's very own Hospitality Business graduate and kayaker Daniel Koh, together with\nhis teammates, secured Singapore a team bronze medal in the men's K4 500m heats. Having been relentless in his pursuit to seal a spot\nat the SEA Games since joining the national team in 2019, Daniel made numerous sacrifices before this victory, not to mention little\nsleep, long days, and lengthy commutes. Thrice a week, he would have to travel to morning trainings at Kallang before heading off for\nclass at SIT@RP Building in Woodlands. His tight schedule and physical trainings saw his assignments and projects pile up incrementally,\nleading to shorter nights and much less sleep. \"It was just really tough,\" he spoke of those moments. \"I cried myself to sleep on most\nweekdays and prayed (that) the next day would be better.\"\nNonetheless, the single-minded determination of donning the Singapore flag on his chest kept him going. \"I prayed a lot, ate a lot and\nslept a lot,\" he recalled. \"I'd sleep in between lessons or take naps on the trains and buses.\" While sleep healed him physically, support\nfrom the university helped tremendously. His schoolmates would often check in on him, from asking about training to ottering cups of\ncoffee. They even arranged project meetings around his hectic schedule. \"My SIT professors and friends were very supportive of me in\nchasing this dream,\" and \"credit goes to them for this success,\" replied Daniel. For the Hospitality Business student who graduated last\nOctober, clinching that medal came as a moment of vindication after three strenuous years of juggling studies and sport. A goal that had\nbeen almost a decade in the making, winning at the SEA Games was \"a dream come true\" for him. And while he has secured his first SEA\ngames medal in his debut, his competitive spirit still lives on.\nSince graduation, Daniel has changed his mind from being a hotelier to a full-time athlete and part-time canoe coach. Citing \"the\ncompetitiveness and adrenaline\" from the events as a driving source of motivation, Daniel now feels ready to \"do a lot more\". With his\nsights now set on bigger tournaments, such as the World Championships held in August, Daniel continues to rely on an invaluable trait he\nlook away from his time spent al SIT and training -persistence.\nSUPPORTED BY·\nmaple tree m SINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\n• •\nm\nDaniel Koh at The Mapletree Challenge 2020. a sustainable innovation competition for SIT undergraduates.

Working with\nleading energy solutions provider ENGIE will help us advance innovation in decarbonization and sustainability, and achieve our vision of\nconstructing a green campus in Punggol. In addition to co-developing integrated and innovative solutions, the close, symbiotic\npartnership we enjoy with ENGIE will enable us to build a strong talent pipeline of work-ready graduates who will lead green\ntransformations in industry and communities,\" remarked SIT President, Prof Chua Kee Chaing.\nDesigned and built by ENGIE, SIT's DCS for its upcoming campus in Punggot Digital District is well underway.  Once completed,  the DCS\nfacility will provide a teaching and training ground for students to learn about DCS and aspects of maintenance and energy efficiency  in\nreal-world conditions. The OCS will extend the Punggol campus' learning environment, complementing the collaborative research in cold\nthermal storage, air-side cooling distribution systems and cooling load management to be carried out there. As a result, SIT students will\npick up skillsets in data-driven optimization, OCS decarbonization and predictive maintenance learning from the new campus'\ninfrastructure. SIT's Punggol campus is expected to start operations in 2024 and will consolidate the university's distributed campuses\ninto one fit-for-purpose yet porous campus that will foster interaction between academia, industry and the community.\nFor the full press release, please go to SIT's Digital Newsroom .\nSIT Partners Rotary to Build Skilled\nWorkforce in Chemicals and Energy\nSector\nThe collaboration will take place on three fronts -workplace learning programmes for Rotary staff, internship\nopportunities for SIT students, and innovation projects.
