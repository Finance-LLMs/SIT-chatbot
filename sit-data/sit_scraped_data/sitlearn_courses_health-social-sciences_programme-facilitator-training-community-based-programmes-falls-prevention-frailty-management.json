    "Falls and frailty persist as prevalent issues among older adults living in the community, and these concerns often coexist.",
    "Currently, many healthcare and community rehabilitation settings in Singapore are actively engaging in risk assessments. A growing trend is observed towards group-based programmes in the community, partly due to manpower constraints and the mounting evidence supporting the effectiveness of such initiatives.",
    "This course is designed to equip community care professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills to administer community-based programmes like \"Stepping On\" and \"Say No To Frailty.\" It aims to introduce structured, group-based community programmes tailored for older adults, which have been piloted or executed within Singapore's context. The course will cover key principles of effective group facilitation using adult learning frameworks, intended to promote positive behavioral transformations within the target population.",
    "\"Stepping On\" is a cost-effective fall prevention programme for older adults residing in the community. It has been widely implemented beyond Singapore and across 9 centers within the country, as of December 2022. Additionally, a multifaceted frailty management programme known as \"Say No To Frailty\" was collaboratively developed with Singapore's community service providers and has been piloted in 8 community sites, as of April 2023. While an ongoing cluster randomised controlled trial is underway, initial findings have showcased promising outcomes, including a reduction in frailty levels and fear of falling, an enhancement of community partnerships, and an improvement in overall quality of life.",
    "An adept programme leader serves as a pivotal element in both the \"Stepping On\" and \"Say No To Frailty\" programmes. Their role is crucial in effectively guiding participants through the behavioral changes necessary for managing their own health and safety.",
    "Participants who complete this course may have an opportunity to attend the advanced training programme to become programme leaders. In this capacity, they will offer guidance and support to other programme facilitators. Furthermore, they will be tasked with conducting fidelity checks to ensure the quality of programme delivery. Selected participants may be invited to assist the master trainer in future training workshops within Singapore.",
