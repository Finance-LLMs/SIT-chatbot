    "You may apply for the degree programme during the annual admission cycle.",
    "chevron--up",
    "How does stacking to a degree work?",
    "Our BSc (Hons) in Applied Computing degree (via the CSM Pathway) offers a flexible and modular structure comprising two foundational micro-credentials in Applied Computing, four specialised micro-credentials in key areas of the field, and two elective micro-credentials (or two specialised micro-credentials in its place).  Relevant micro-credentials that you obtain can be stacked progressively to complete this degree.",
    "In addition to SIT’s micro-credentials, your pathway to a degree will also take into account other prior learning such as industry certifications or competencies acquired from work, which will provide you with credit or exemptions.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Who is eligible to apply for the degree programme?",
    "Only in-employment individuals will be considered.",

    "Professional Development. You may enrol in the degree subsequently when your employment status has changed.",
    "chevron--up",
    "Do I need to take micro-credentials in a particular order?",
    "Although we provide a recommended study pathway for the degree programme , you are not required to take micro-credentials in a prescribed order. SIT will state the recommended baseline competencies that an individual should have before embarking on a micro-credential.",

    "chevron--up",
    "What is the structure of micro-credentials?",
    "Micro-credentials are largely taught asynchronously, which gives you the flexibility to learn whenever and wherever you choose. While each micro-credential combines online and in-person delivery, the learning activities vary for each micro-credential.",
