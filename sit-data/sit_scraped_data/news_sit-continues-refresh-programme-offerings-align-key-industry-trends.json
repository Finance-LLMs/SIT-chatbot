    "Strengthening Education Offerings through ‘Term-In Term-Out’ (TITO)",
    "In AY2022, SIT introduced the new TITO pathway, where students alternate their time between the university and the workplace every year. At the end of their undergraduate studies, students would effectively have spent nearly half of their time learning in authentic industry settings, without extending the duration of their degree programme. At the same time, sponsoring companies will be able to green harvest talents in an area of high demand.",

At the end of their undergraduate studies, students would effectively have spent nearly half of their time learning in authentic industry settings, without extending the duration of their degree programme. At the same time, sponsoring companies will be able to green harvest talents in an area of high demand.\nSince 2022, the university has secured the commitment of 15 companies for three degree programmes in Applied Computing (with Fintech specialisation), Digital Supply Chain, and Robotics Systems. These companies will provide work placements for students throughout the course of study.\n“As Singapore’s university of applied learning, SIT has grown from strength to strength in nurturing an industry-ready workforce to drive Singapore’s future growth,” said\nProfessor Chua Kee Chaing, President, SIT\n. “The TITO pathway exemplifies the foundation of our applied learning pedagogy that is ‘learning by doing’, and we believe that this will give students a stronger head-start to the working world by exposing them to the latest industry developments, business intricacies and work cultures.”\nAll programmes with TITO pathway require students to work on capstone projects in collaboration with industry partners, in addition to their job scope while attached to the sponsoring companies. More details on the TITO pathway are available in\nAppendix A\n.\nInterested applicants can apply for programmes with TITO pathway during the AY2023 Admissions Exercise.\nGrooming next-gen stewards of sustainability\nPropelled by the national sustainability agenda of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, there will be a greater need for knowledge and skill sets in sustainability within the workforce, especially with the green economy being earmarked as one of the three growth areas for Singapore.\n[1]\nSIT recognises its role in building capability for sustainability efforts with the introduction of:\nMinor in Environmental Sustainability\nIn AY2023, SIT will launch a Minor in Environmental Sustainability for undergraduate students of selected programmes, such as the Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Electrical Power Engineering (EPE) degree programme.\nMicro-module (MM)\nIntroduced in AY2022, all Year 1 SIT and SIT-joint degree undergraduates will receive a baseline sustainability education through a compulsory MM that prepares students with the fundamentals of sustainable development. The MM also supports the further learning of sustainability-related modules and projects undertaken in subsequent years. The sustainability education in SIT is created involving the industry and local agencies in ensuring its relevancy and futureproofing.\n”As concerns about climate change grow, sustainable development is an increasingly important agenda for economies worldwide – especially for an island state like Singapore,” said\nProfessor John Thong, Deputy President (Academic) & Provost, SIT\n. “We are committed to empower SIT graduates of various disciplines to have an edge in advancing environmental sustainability for organisations, industries, and the nation.”\nSupporting Transformation in Built Environment and Engineering Systems\nIn a highly urbanised city like Singapore, the built environment has an important role to play in sustainable development as buildings account for over 20 per cent of total national emissions.\n[2]\nInformation and computing technology are also projected to consume up to 20% of global energy demand by 2030, with microelectronics manufacturing accounting for most of its carbon footprint.\n[3]\nLand transport and microelectronics manufacturing are critical industry sectors in the next phase of Singapore’s economic transformation. With the transformation of the built environment and engineering systems comes a demand for new skills, thus necessitating the continuous refresh of SIT’s degree programmes to be relevant for students:\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Sustainable Built Environment (SBE)\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Engineering Systems (ESE)\nPreviously offered as:\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services)\nPreviously offered as:\nBachelor of Engineering with Honours in Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Land)\nCurriculum changes to the programme:\nSpecialisation electives in Integrated Facility Management and Green Building Design\nAdditional Environmental Sustainability modules with an enhanced focus in Sustainable Urban Systems\nCurriculum changes to the programme:\nSpecialisation electives in Land Transport and Microelectronics Manufacturing\nNew optional minor in Environmental Sustainability\nThe name change and additional Environmental Sustainability modules for both degree programmes will be in effect from AY2023 onwards.\nAY2023 Admissions Exercise\nFor AY2023, SIT will offer 39 undergraduate degree programmes, of which 21 are SIT-conferred, 14 are joint degrees, and four are offered by overseas university partners. SIT also offers four postgraduate degree programmes and four industrial postgraduate degree programmes.\nVisit\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/undergraduate-programmes\nfor the full list of degree programmes. Applications for admission to SIT in AY2023 open from 10 January to 19 March 2023 at\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate\n.\nOpen House 2023\nSIT Open House 2023 will be held from 14 to 15 January 2023, 10 am to 6 pm at Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre, Level 3, as well as online.\nFeaturing talks and panel discussions by SIT professors and staff, as well as hands-on workshops and classes, SIT Open House 2023 offers prospective students and their families the chance to discover the university’s suite of degree programmes and experience how SIT provides a holistic applied learning education.\nThose interested can peruse the events calendar and register their interest to attend SIT Open House 2023 at\nhttps://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/openhouse/\n.\nAppendix A: TITO Pathway\nUndergraduates of the Bachelor of Science with Honours in\nApplied Computing with a specialisation in Fintech\n, launched in AY2022, will spend a total of 16 months of industry exposure throughout their three-year undergraduate studies. The robust model allows enhanced learning whilst not extending the length of the degree programme. The TITO model has garnered support from AIA Singapore, DBS Bank, Infosys, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), Prudential Singapore, Standard Chartered Bank and United Overseas Bank (UOB).\nStudents of the Bachelor of Science with Honours in\nDigital Supply Chain\nprogramme, also launched in AY2022, will spend 12 months throughout their three-year undergraduate studies, in partnering logistics and supply chain companies. The work-study attachments include a module on ‘Warehouse and Transportation Systems’, which involves real-world learning in an industry environment that is integrated into their work. Sponsoring companies include Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Kuehne+Nagel, Markono, SingPost, ST Logistics, Venture Corporation and YCH Group. In addition, DSC students will also attend classes at SCALA (Supply Chain and Logistics Academy) located at YCH Group for half a day per week, taught by industry experts.\nIn AY2023, SIT will roll out the TITO pathway in partnership with Siemens for the Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in\nRobotics Systems\ndegree programme. The mode of learning will deepen graduates’ knowledge and skills for the advanced manufacturing sector, such as robotics systems development, systems engineering, and artificial intelligence (AI). Such skill sets will enable companies to build Industry 4.0 capabilities. Demand for these skill sets is growing, due to the rapid rise in robotics, machine learning and the Internet of Things. SIT and Siemens will also work together to bring on other companies to participate in the programme, as well as co-develop the curriculum, recruitment strategies and assessment frameworks. Students will spend 16 months out in the industry over the course of their four-year undergraduate studies.\n[1]\nSkills Demand for Future Economy.\nhttps://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skillsreport\n[2]\nSingapore Green Building Masterplan.\nhttps://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/singapore-green-building-masterplan\n[3]\nSpeech by MOS Alvin Tan at the SSIA Semiconductor Business Connect 2022.\nhttps://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Speeches/2022/05/Speech-by-MOS-Alvin-Tan-at-the-SSIA-Semiconductor-Business-Connect-2022\nTopics\nApplied Learning\nIndustry\nSustainability\nNACE\nAdmissions\nIntegrated Work Study Programme\nSITizens\nLifelong Learning\nCATEGORIES\nPress Releases\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nIndustry & Community\nAcademic Clusters\nEngineering\nInfocomm Technology\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nFinding Strength in Adversity\nview\nNext\nNew ‘Forward SITizen’ Initiative to Support SIT Undergraduates\nview\nRelated News\n01 Apr 2025\nABS and the Singapore Institute of Technology Sign Strategic Agreement to Explore Innovation in Applied Research and Talent Development\nAdvancing Cutting-Edge Maritime Technologies and Nurturing Industry-Ready Talent\ntag\nPress Releases, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering\n06 Jan 2025\nSIT Introduces Singapore’s First Competency-Based Undergraduate Engineering Degrees and a Unique Interdisciplinary Business Programme\nSIT pioneers Competency-based Education (CBE) for Engineering undergraduates with two new degree programmes in Academic Year 2025.\ntag\nPress Releases, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design\n16 Oct 2024\nSIT Awards New Transcripts to Recognise Graduates’ Transferable Skills\nClass of 2024 graduates from two programmes are the first batch to receive the Record of Transferable Skills (RTS) transcripts.\ntag\nPress Releases, Education"
