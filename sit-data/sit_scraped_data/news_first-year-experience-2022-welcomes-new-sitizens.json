    "First Year Experience 2022 Welcomes New SITizens",
    "After a two-year hiatus from physical events, SIT welcomed freshmen for Academic Year 2022/23 in person at SIT@Dover for an unforgettable First-Year Experience (FYE).",
    "Welcome to your new home, SITizens! (SIT Photo)",
    "From 20 to 26 August 2022, more than 2,800 freshmen learned more about SIT through a series of induction programmes – University Life Club Fair, Day Zero, and Helix.",
    "New Academic Journey",
    "Rishab Sharma, President of the FYE Exco and Year 2 Air Transport Management student said, “It has been two years since SIT organised a physical induction programme, and I see this as the start of a new academic journey.”",
    "It took 800 student organisers and facilitators four months to prepare for the event. The objective was to create a holistic and immersive orientation programme for our new SITizens.",
    "Rishab shared that the journey had its highs and lows but his team, together with guidance from the Student Life Division (SLD), worked really hard and managed to create a memorable First Year Experience 2022 for everyone.",
    "University Life Club Fair",
    "Prof John Thong chatting with students at the University Life Club Fair.",
    "(SIT Photo)",
    "Held on 20 August, the Fair gave freshmen a taste of SIT’s vibrant university life. Student organisations and SIT divisions put together more than 100 exhibition booths, and participants were treated to 40 student performances and workshops.",
    "Freshmen visiting the exhibition booths by student organisations and SIT divisions.",
    "(SIT Photo)",
    "The inaugural ‘Fireside Chat with Adult Learners’ attracted 37 adult learners, who got an opportunity to hear from A/Prof Foo Yong Lim, Assoc Provost (Academic Programmes); A/Prof Elaine Siow, Asst Provost (Student Experience); Ms Zoe Peters, Director, Student Life; and current adult learner, Ms Tai Kit Ping from the Physiotherapy programme.",
    "Attendees at the inaugural ‘Fireside Chat with Adult Learners’.",
    "(SIT Photo)",
    "Participants exchanged stories about how they adjusted to the hectic pace of academic demands, how they communicated with the younger generation, and what they did to adapt to university life.",
    "Day Zero",
    "Prof Chua Kee Chaing (centre) at the morning session for the Infocomm Technology Academic Cluster at Day Zero.",
    "(SIT Photo)",
    "This year’s Day Zero, held from 22 to 25 August, was an induction to SIT’s unique applied learning pedagogy. It also provided a platform for purposeful interaction between first-year students, seniors, and faculty from the same programme.",
    "Day Zero took place over seven sessions, covering five academic clusters, and included an inaugural panel discussion with industry partners, SIT senior management, faculty, and student representatives. Panelists shared their perspectives on current and future industry trends and the necessary skill sets students need to be industry ready.",
    "Helix",
    "Freshmen getting into the spirit of things at Helix.",
    "(SIT Photo)",
    "To close the week-long orientation, freshmen had the opportunity to interact with each other and experience SIT’s culture, values, and SITizen-DNA through Helix on 26 August. This programme was specially curated to encourage networking across SIT’s clusters. Freshmen had a great time displaying their hidden talents through performances and making new friendships through various group activities.",
    "Freshmen performing at Helix. (SIT Photo)",
    "Freshman Kairos El Varro from the Physiotherapy programme said, “I entered FYE with a mindset to meet new faces in a new environment. University life is different from pre-tertiary institutions because it is where we will learn and be trained to progress into the workforce. I’m glad that through FYE, I got to meet like-minded friends that I might potentially work with in the future.”",

(SIT Photo)\nFrom 20 to 26 August 2022, more than 2,800 freshmen learned more about SIT through a series of induction programmes – University Life Club Fair, Day Zero, and Helix.\nNew Academic Journey\nRishab Sharma, President of the FYE Exco and Year 2 Air Transport Management student said, “It has been two years since SIT organised a physical induction programme, and I see this as the start of a new academic journey.”\nIt took 800 student organisers and facilitators four months to prepare for the event. The objective was to create a holistic and immersive orientation programme for our new SITizens.\nRishab shared that the journey had its highs and lows but his team, together with guidance from the Student Life Division (SLD), worked really hard and managed to create a memorable First Year Experience 2022 for everyone.\nUniversity Life Club Fair\nProf John Thong chatting with students at the University Life Club Fair.\n(SIT Photo)\nHeld on 20 August, the Fair gave freshmen a taste of SIT’s vibrant university life. Student organisations and SIT divisions put together more than 100 exhibition booths, and participants were treated to 40 student performances and workshops.\nFreshmen visiting the exhibition booths by student organisations and SIT divisions.\n(SIT Photo)\nThe inaugural ‘Fireside Chat with Adult Learners’ attracted 37 adult learners, who got an opportunity to hear from A/Prof Foo Yong Lim, Assoc Provost (Academic Programmes); A/Prof Elaine Siow, Asst Provost (Student Experience); Ms Zoe Peters, Director, Student Life; and current adult learner, Ms Tai Kit Ping from the Physiotherapy programme.\nAttendees at the inaugural ‘Fireside Chat with Adult Learners’.\n(SIT Photo)\nParticipants exchanged stories about how they adjusted to the hectic pace of academic demands, how they communicated with the younger generation, and what they did to adapt to university life.\nDay Zero\nProf Chua Kee Chaing (centre) at the morning session for the Infocomm Technology Academic Cluster at Day Zero.\n(SIT Photo)\nThis year’s Day Zero, held from 22 to 25 August, was an induction to SIT’s unique applied learning pedagogy. It also provided a platform for purposeful interaction between first-year students, seniors, and faculty from the same programme.\nDay Zero took place over seven sessions, covering five academic clusters, and included an inaugural panel discussion with industry partners, SIT senior management, faculty, and student representatives. Panelists shared their perspectives on current and future industry trends and the necessary skill sets students need to be industry ready.\nHelix\nFreshmen getting into the spirit of things at Helix.\n(SIT Photo)\nTo close the week-long orientation, freshmen had the opportunity to interact with each other and experience SIT’s culture, values, and SITizen-DNA through Helix on 26 August. This programme was specially curated to encourage networking across SIT’s clusters. Freshmen had a great time displaying their hidden talents through performances and making new friendships through various group activities.\nFreshmen performing at Helix. (SIT Photo)\nFreshman Kairos El Varro from the Physiotherapy programme said, “I entered FYE with a mindset to meet new faces in a new environment. University life is different from pre-tertiary institutions because it is where we will learn and be trained to progress into the workforce. I’m glad that through FYE, I got to meet like-minded friends that I might potentially work with in the future.”\nTopics\nSITizens\nFeatures\nCATEGORIES\nEducation\nSITizens & Campus\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nGiving Patients Hope with Rehabilitation Robotics\nview\nNext\nTeaching the Art of Mentoring by Asking ‘What Else?’\nview\nRelated News\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n25 Apr 2025\nA Serendipitous Partnership and the SIT Connection\nSITizen Ng Yan Ying's journey from a public hospital clinician to the co-founder of a thriving private practice is nothing short of inspiring.\ntag\nEducation, SITizens & Campus, Health and Social Sciences\n22 Apr 2025\nSailing Towards a Greener Horizon Together\nHow SIT is helping to green Singapore’s maritime industry through industry collaborations and cutting-edge R&D.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Industry & Community, Engineering"
