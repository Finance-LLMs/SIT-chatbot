Valued at $5,000 each, at least six or up to nine Bursaries will be given out annually and in perpetuity, from the new\nAcademic Year 2022/23 onwards.\nMr Eng was the Founder Chairman of Sin Heng Chan Group, but he had come from an impoverished background. His parents passed on\nwhen he was three, leaving him under the charge of his elder siblings. He first set foot on the shores of Singapore in 1936 with little on\nhim, and he soon found work earning a meagre income. He taught himself languages such as Malay, English and Indonesian from books\nas he knew that he needed to be able to communicate with people from different cultural backgrou nds and ethnicities in order to make a\nlivelihood. With a strong entrepreneurial spirit burning in him, he gathered two friends and they opened their first provision store on\nRochor Road. Experiencing World War II also made Mr Eng more determined to overcome any hardship and in 1947, he started Sin Heng\nChan which focused on rice trading. His business grew rapidly -now known as The SHC Group, it is one of Singapore's longest privately\nowned corporations with a focus in two key areas -property development and hospitality management.\nSaid Mr Eng Bak Chim, Managing Director, The SHC Group, \"The late Mr Eng believed that possessing strong willpower, determination\nand the ability to endure difficulties, will see one through many challengi ng moments in life. We hope that this bursary will encourage\nstudents at SIT to press on and see difficulties encountered in their lives as opportunities for growth.\"\nSaid Prof Chua Kee Chaing, President, SIT, \"I just wish to say how much we appreciate this generous gift for our students. Many of our\nyoung SITizens come from less privileged backgrounds and are the first in their families to attend university. This very thoughtful gift\nfrom the Estate of Mr Eng Liat Kiang will give them the support they need to focus on their studies and help them realise their potential,\nin spite of their financial circumstances. The ELK Bursary will generate a positive multiplier effect, for the industry and the community, in\nyears to come.\"\nBespoke Hip Protector Enhances\nSafety of Fall-prone Seniors\nDeveloped by SIT and G4 Pte Ltd, the lightweight and breathable EXO+ hip protector otters protection for fall­\nprone residents of Ren Ci Hospital\nEl 07 January 2022\nAssoc Prof Soh Chew Seng (right), Programme Leader, Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Building Services). SIT and Mr Samuel Lim, former Research\nEngineer at SIT, displaying the hip protector belts 1n the charactet1sa11on lab at SlT@Oover , where they performed material characterisa11on.\nSIT and G4 Pte Ltd have collaborated with Ren Ci Hospital to develop a customised hip protector that offers good protection and comfort\nfor fall-prone seniors. Ren Ci Hospital is the first facility in the community care sector to trial the EXO+, a lightweight hip protector made\nwith breathable material for the local climate. The patented hip protector features a foam pad made of sandwiched layers of impact­\nabsorbing foam and elastomers to cushion the wearer's hip in the event of a fall.\nFollowing positive feedback from residents, Ren Ci Hospital will be deploying the hip protector at both its nursing homes to selected\nresidents with fall-risk potential due to gait or lower limb weakness.\n\"We expect hip fractures among seniors to be on the rise as the population ages. While there are existing hip protectors in the market,\nmost are not easy to put on. They also trap heat when worn for long hours and cause discomfort for the elderly. Compliance becomes a\nreal issue. In comparison, EXO+ is easy to wear, more breathable, and suitable for our local climate -all the benefits that aid initial\nacceptance by our elderly residents. This removes problems with compliance , so our seniors, especially those with osteoporosis, can\navoid potentially life-threatening hip fractures,\" said Ms Tan Tzuu Ling, Assistant Director, Nursing at Ren Ci Hospital.\n(\nDonning the EXO• hip protector has given Mr Mohamad Hafidz bin Samat, 59, added confidence 10 walk more and rely lass on his wheelchair.

The Rotary Club\nof Tanglin, Singapore is committed to service, and we find a resonance in SIT's endeavou rs to develop individuals who build on their\ninterests and talents to impact society. It is our hope that this Scholarship will create a ripple effect in the lives of the recipients and the\npeople that they go on to serve.\"\nThis is not the first time members of the Rotary Club of Tanglin have come together to nurture students at SIT. Earlier in 2018, the Club\nhad made possible the Rotary Club of Tanglin & Tong Kok Chiang Scholarsh ip. The Rotary Club of Tanglin, Singapore, was founded in April\n1984 and its members have been involved in many areas of service to reach out to different groups of people including the sick, the\nhandicapped, the underprivileged and those afflicted by natural disasters.\nSaid Prof Chua Kee Chaing, President, SIT, \"SIT is grateful lo have found such inspiring friends in Mr Alvin Goh and the members of the\nRotary Club of Tanglin, Singapore . We are also very honoured to have the Club's steadfast and nurturing support since 2018. I have no\ndoubt that this impactful Scholarship will nurture community leaders who have a heart to serve, much like the Rotarians who have made\npossible this Scholarsh ip.\"\nThe permanent Rotary Club of Tangltn & Alvin Goh Scholarship 1s applicable to undergraduates from all d1sc1pl,nes at SIT.\nSIT and TradeFlow Collaborate to\nEnhance Shipping Industry Efficiency\nwith AI\nAI-driven solution will predict and reduce risk in international shipping to increase operational efficiencies and\nreduce cost\nEl 07 January 2022\nTradeFlow Capital Management (TradeFlow) and the Singapore Institute of Technology (srn are pleased to announce a collaboration to\nco-create an artificial intelligence (AI} driven solution to better address risk and efficiency issues in the international shipping industry.\nWith the shipping and maritime sector contributing around 7% of Singapore's gross domestic product and more than 130,000 ships\nannually calling at Singapore , the digitalised solution shall benefit Singapore's status as an internationa l shipping hub.\nThe project aims to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor, measure, analyse, predict, and in turn, help manage the\nrisk that a company will face demurrage on shipments of bulk commoditi es around the world.\nFor the full story, please go to SIT's Digital Newsroom: htlP-s://www.sin~P-oretech. edu.sg[Qig italnewsroom/sit-and-tracleflow•\ncol la borate-to-en hance-shj o Ri.og-jndustry-effi cjency-wjth-ai/\nFrom Culinary School to Odette, and\nBack to School\nAfter eight years working in Singapore's finest kitchens, Culinary Institute of America (CIA) Singapore alumna\nElaine Koh returns to her alma mater. Now, she is vested in grooming Singapore's future culinary professio nals\nEl 07 January 2022\nAn avid baker and cook, Elaine was halfway through her diploma programme when she realised that her heart was set on working in the\nkitchen. So, she started her research on various culinary schools but only found short-term diploma programmes or courses by private\nculinary schools.\nThen, she heard the news that the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) was coming to Singapore .\nAs one of the world's premier colleges, CIA offers a renowned culinary degree programme for students who want to develop their\nculinary skills. Through a partnership with SIT, CIA opened its first international campus in Singapore.\nWorking With the Best\nAs part of the school curriculum, Elaine was required to complete seven hours in the kitchen, followed by four hours of study for her\nacademic modules. It was gruelling work but it helped her with the transition to restaurant kitchens, where long hours are the norm.\nPollen, a restaurant located at Gardens by the Bay, was the first professiona l kitchen Elaine worked at as an intern. She then went on to\nwork at The Dempsey Cookhouse and Bar before joining Chef Julien Royer in Odette, then ranked eighth on the World's 50 Best\nRestaurants List. As a member of the team that launched the restaurant, she was elated when Odette won two Michelin stars in the first\nyear it opened.\nFrom Kitchen to Classroom\nWith eight years of experience under her belt, Elaine's extensive skill set drew the attention of Chef Eve Felder, Managing Director of CIA,\nwho was on the lookout for an instructor for the school.\n\"At CIA, we hire professionals, and not purely teachers, because we need people who are at the top of their game, those individuals who\nhave had a progressive career path,\" shared Chef Felder.\nElaine Koh (right) pictured with Chef Eve Felder, Managing Director, CIA Singapore. who was instrumental in her culinary journey and return to the renowned\nculinary academy.\nElaine never expected to venture into teaching. She had grown accustome d to the hectic environment of the kitchen and wondered if she\nhad the patience to be a teacher. However, the unwavering support she received from her family eventually made her decide to make the\nswitch.\nNow, having completed her first year of teaching at CIA in September 2020, the journey has been a two-way learning experience for both\nElaine and her students.\n\"Some people say that teaching is the end of your culinary journey but that's not true. You're still pushing the boundaries, but you're\npushing it together with your students.\" she shared.\nTeaching in a school kitchen gives Elaine the chance to use her creativity, and undoubted ly, the opportunity to still learn something new\nevery day.\nFor the full story, please go to SIT's Digital Newsroom: b.Ups://www singaporetech edu.sw.figita[oewsroom/from-cu[inary-scbool•to­\nodette-and-back-to-school/\n'\nI ' \\ _ .... ~ -i ' 3i •. ,, ' ~ .\n.. ~ ....
