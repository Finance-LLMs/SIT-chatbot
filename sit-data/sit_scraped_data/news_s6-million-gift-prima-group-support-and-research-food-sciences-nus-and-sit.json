    "NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye (far left, front row) and Professor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT (far right, front row) accepted the cheques on behalf of their universities from Mr Primus Cheng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prima Limited (third from left, front row).",
    "The National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) today received gifts totalling S$6 million from the Prima Group, in conjunction with its diamond anniversary, which will support a professorship, scholarships and research in food sciences.",
    "The Prima Group, led by its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr Primus Cheng Chih Kwong, commemorates its 60th year milestone by channeling its resources into education endowment and research funds, in lieu of lavish celebrations. This tradition was started by Mr Cheng’s late father, Mr Cheng Tsang Man, who founded the Prima flour mill in 1961. NUS and SIT will each receive a S$3 million gift towards the Food Science and Technology discipline.",
    "Contributions towards education and research in the field of food science and technology will play a vital role in bolstering Singapore’s efforts towards the long-term sustainability of food safety and security.",
    "Accepting the cheques on behalf of their universities from Mr Primus Cheng are NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye and SIT President Professor Tan Thiam Soon.",
    "Mr Primus Cheng said, “For our 50th anniversary, Prima had chosen to support the cause of education because we firmly believe that education is the foremost fundamental enabler. It is only with education that people can become self-reliant and utilise their skills and knowledge for the betterment of mankind. For our diamond anniversary this year, we want to commemorate this milestone in a more impactful manner by supporting both universities’ education and research efforts in food science and technology which would in turn improve food quality and nutritional value as well as enhance the safety of food for societies at large. The enabling effect of education can only be maximised if people can also have adequate, safe and nutritious food. As a food conglomerate, it is our hope that our gift will provide more synergistic impact.”",
    "Prima has been a strong supporter of NUS and it has contributed to a wide range of student and research programmes across the University.",
    "NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye said, “",
    "We are grateful for Prima’s generosity and their continued partnership with NUS.",
    "This latest gift will enable the University to support the advancement of Singapore’s food industry and achieve food resilience and security",
    ".",
    "We will establish the Cheng Tsang Man Professorship in Food Science and Technology which will help the University to attract and retain world renowned academics who can spearhead breakthroughs in research while offering new dimensions of teaching and learning",
    "in nurturing future generations of food scientists and technologists.",
    "The donation will also provide undergraduate scholarships to students at the Department of",
    "Food Science and Technology who wish to pursue their interest in this field of study.",
    "”",
    "Professor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT, welcomes the Prima Group’s philanthropic leadership to encourage industry innovation and transformation, as well as nurture young talents in the field of food technology. Prof Tan said, “Prima’s endowed gift of S$3 million to SIT will enable us to establish the Prima Group Applied Research Grant to support innovation projects focused on closing technological gaps in food manufacturing and processing. Furthermore, Prima’s generous gift will allow us to award at least three Prima Group Scholarships annually to academically talented Food Technology undergraduates at SIT.” He added, “SIT is focused on applied research and innovation to bridge knowledge discovery and application. SIT is honoured to partner the Prima Group, a global name in the food manufacturing industry, in this philanthropic initiative.”",

This tradition was started by Mr Cheng’s late father, Mr Cheng Tsang Man, who founded the Prima flour mill in 1961. NUS and SIT will each receive a S$3 million gift towards the Food Science and Technology discipline.\nContributions towards education and research in the field of food science and technology will play a vital role in bolstering Singapore’s efforts towards the long-term sustainability of food safety and security.\nAccepting the cheques on behalf of their universities from Mr Primus Cheng are NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye and SIT President Professor Tan Thiam Soon.\nMr Primus Cheng said, “For our 50th anniversary, Prima had chosen to support the cause of education because we firmly believe that education is the foremost fundamental enabler. It is only with education that people can become self-reliant and utilise their skills and knowledge for the betterment of mankind. For our diamond anniversary this year, we want to commemorate this milestone in a more impactful manner by supporting both universities’ education and research efforts in food science and technology which would in turn improve food quality and nutritional value as well as enhance the safety of food for societies at large. The enabling effect of education can only be maximised if people can also have adequate, safe and nutritious food. As a food conglomerate, it is our hope that our gift will provide more synergistic impact.”\nPrima has been a strong supporter of NUS and it has contributed to a wide range of student and research programmes across the University.\nNUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye said, “\nWe are grateful for Prima’s generosity and their continued partnership with NUS.\nThis latest gift will enable the University to support the advancement of Singapore’s food industry and achieve food resilience and security\n.\nWe will establish the Cheng Tsang Man Professorship in Food Science and Technology which will help the University to attract and retain world renowned academics who can spearhead breakthroughs in research while offering new dimensions of teaching and learning\nin nurturing future generations of food scientists and technologists.\nThe donation will also provide undergraduate scholarships to students at the Department of\nFood Science and Technology who wish to pursue their interest in this field of study.\n”\nProfessor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT, welcomes the Prima Group’s philanthropic leadership to encourage industry innovation and transformation, as well as nurture young talents in the field of food technology. Prof Tan said, “Prima’s endowed gift of S$3 million to SIT will enable us to establish the Prima Group Applied Research Grant to support innovation projects focused on closing technological gaps in food manufacturing and processing. Furthermore, Prima’s generous gift will allow us to award at least three Prima Group Scholarships annually to academically talented Food Technology undergraduates at SIT.” He added, “SIT is focused on applied research and innovation to bridge knowledge discovery and application. SIT is honoured to partner the Prima Group, a global name in the food manufacturing industry, in this philanthropic initiative.”\nTopics\nApplied Research\nCATEGORIES\nFood, Chemical and Biotechnology\nAcademic Clusters\nApplied Research & Innovation\nPress Releases\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nClass of 2020: Reflections on the SIT Journey\nview\nNext\nHow This Singapore University Is Preparing Its Graduates for Future Uncertainties\nview\nRelated News\n30 Apr 2025\nStuffed with Success: CIA Alumna Wins First-Ever World Stuffed Cabbage Championship\nCIA Singapore alumna Bernadette Rozario, a sous-chef at French brasserie Claudine Singapore, beats the French at their own game.\ntag\nSITizens & Campus, Business, Communication and Design, Engineering, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n26 Mar 2025\nPower Through Emotion\nSIT, Chemistry and Pod of Life unveil a new approach to combat workplace burnout through The Emotional Baggage Board Game.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Academic Clusters, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n04 Feb 2025\nEmpowering Engineers for the Future\nThe Singapore Institute of Technology introduces a competency-based education model for its Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) degree programme\ntag\nEducation, Industry & Community, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology"
