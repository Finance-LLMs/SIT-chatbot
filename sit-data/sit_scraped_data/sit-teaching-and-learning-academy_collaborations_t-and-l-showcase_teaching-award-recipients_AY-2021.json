    "Mui Kim aspires to be a role model and a coach to her students. With students describing her as being passionate, knowledgeable, and approachable, among others, it is clear that she has succeeded in doing so.",
    "Mui Kim acknowledges that no one learner is the same. She uses a variety of teaching methods, such as mind maps, interactive videos, gallery walks, think-pair-share, case studies, and blended learning to meet diverse learning needs.",
    "Being acutely aware that learning is both a cognitive and emotional experience, Mui Kim endeavours to continue creating an inclusive classroom environment to help students learn effectively..",

    "Ms Guo Tong",
    "Guo Tong taps on her professional experience as a paediatric speech and language therapist, in which she has learnt about scaffolding children’s learning based on their needs and abilities. She has applied this principle to her current teaching in tertiary education. Central to her pedagogy is Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) – by pitching teaching activities at the right level, students are better able to grasp the concepts and eventually apply them.",
    "(Citation by POD Evaluation Committee Member)",
    "Dr Ho Jiahui",
    "Jiahui puts in commendable efforts in developing industry-relevant module content and providing students with timely feedback. She recollects her own undergraduate days of developing flowcharts for problem-solving and the use of mnemonics which helped improve her grades significantly. Now, she incorporates those techniques to design mind maps, help sheets, and virtual escape rooms to deliver her lessons in a fun yet effective way.",
    "(Citation by ENG Evaluation Committee Member)",
    "Dr Jesslyn Lim",
    "Jesslyn reflects the inquiring mind of an accountancy educator and adopts a data-driven approach when planning lessons to deliver maximum impact. Teaching and research go hand-in-hand for her, and in AY2022, she embarked on two analytical projects on applied learning: one based on a finance module she taught, and the other an interdisciplinary study on technology-assisted learning. The results of the projects were presented at the Applied Learning Conference 2022. She believes that research creates knowledge, and knowledge drives improvement.",
    "Jesslyn keeps herself abreast with the latest cultural phenomena to keep her lessons engaging and current. This makes her an endearing and effective educator to her learners.",

    "Dr Paolo Del Linz",
    "Paolo is sincere in teaching and aims to foster an interest in learning in his students. He designs module contents to promote independent learning, using real-world applications and open-ended, complex assessment tasks. This approach teaches students how to solve such problems and encourages independent exploration of solutions.",

She uses a variety of teaching methods, such as mind maps, interactive videos, gallery walks, think-pair-share, case studies, and blended learning to meet diverse learning needs.\nBeing acutely aware that learning is both a cognitive and emotional experience, Mui Kim endeavours to continue creating an inclusive classroom environment to help students learn effectively..\n(Citation by BCD Evaluation Committee Member)\nMs Deborah Lim\nDeborah believes that each student learns in his or her unique way. Hence, she challenges herself to find the most efficient and innovative way to impart knowledge to her students. Deborah also injects real-life examples and situations into her teaching to make lessons more meaningful. Deborah exemplifies the attributes of a hospitality professional through maintaining her professional image and engaging in regular interactions with her students, colleagues, and industry partners.\n(Citation by POD Evaluation Committee Member)\nMr Erick Tan\nErick goes out of his way to prepare his lessons to engage all his students - the vocal ones, pensive ones and easily distracted ones. This takes critical thinking and audience-centred communication, both of which are synonymous with the work at the Centre for Professional Communication. He employs different teaching styles and techniques to help students with different needs to optimize their learning.\n(Citation by CPC Evaluation Committee Member)\nMs Guo Tong\nGuo Tong taps on her professional experience as a paediatric speech and language therapist, in which she has learnt about scaffolding children’s learning based on their needs and abilities. She has applied this principle to her current teaching in tertiary education. Central to her pedagogy is Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) – by pitching teaching activities at the right level, students are better able to grasp the concepts and eventually apply them.\n(Citation by POD Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Ho Jiahui\nJiahui puts in commendable efforts in developing industry-relevant module content and providing students with timely feedback. She recollects her own undergraduate days of developing flowcharts for problem-solving and the use of mnemonics which helped improve her grades significantly. Now, she incorporates those techniques to design mind maps, help sheets, and virtual escape rooms to deliver her lessons in a fun yet effective way.\n(Citation by ENG Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Jesslyn Lim\nJesslyn reflects the inquiring mind of an accountancy educator and adopts a data-driven approach when planning lessons to deliver maximum impact. Teaching and research go hand-in-hand for her, and in AY2022, she embarked on two analytical projects on applied learning: one based on a finance module she taught, and the other an interdisciplinary study on technology-assisted learning. The results of the projects were presented at the Applied Learning Conference 2022. She believes that research creates knowledge, and knowledge drives improvement.\nJesslyn keeps herself abreast with the latest cultural phenomena to keep her lessons engaging and current. This makes her an endearing and effective educator to her learners.\n(Citation by BCD Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Lee Hwee Hoon\nHwee Hoon is a committed educator who pushes herself to constantly innovate her teaching methods by using various technology tools to make her lessons interesting. She is committed to helping her students learn and grow, and always provides detailed feedback for their assignments.\n(Citation by CPC Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Malcolm Low\nMalcolm is an exceptional educator who goes above and beyond to ensure that his students receive the best possible learning experience. He believes in the power of active learning and employs a range of innovative tools and interactive activities to help students learn by doing.\nMalcolm explores different educational technologies to keep students engaged and motivated. His Team-based Learning (TBL) approach, which involves industry practitioners and fosters authentic learning experiences, is a prime example of his commitment to excellence. Malcolm's dedication to pedagogical innovation is further demonstrated through his involvement in ALIGN grants, which allows him to explore and develop new teaching methods and discipline-specific pedagogies.\n(Citation by ICT Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Ng Lee Keng\nKnown to her students for being tough and exacting, yet kind and compassionate, Lee Keng makes every effort to prepare and deliver her lessons well. Positive feedback from students attests to her diligence and passion.\nA former Teaching Excellence Award recipient, Lee Keng harnesses technology and engages industry partners to keep her lessons current and relevant.\nOutside of the classroom, she is readily accessible to students who need advice and extra coaching. Students look to her as a genuine educator and inspiring role model.\n(Citation by BCD Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Paolo Del Linz\nPaolo is sincere in teaching and aims to foster an interest in learning in his students. He designs module contents to promote independent learning, using real-world applications and open-ended, complex assessment tasks. This approach teaches students how to solve such problems and encourages independent exploration of solutions.\nPaolo is readily available for his students. He arranges consultation sessions, demonstrating his commitment to student learning and development. He is also forthcoming to adopt new ways of teaching, such as the use of a virtual laboratory or a flipped classroom approach.​\n(Citation by ENG Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Peter Waszecki\nPeter is a passionate and dynamic educator who is dedicated to inspiring his students to develop a genuine love for learning. He employs a student-centric approach that emphasises active engagement and critical thinking. In addition, he constantly explores new technologies and learning tools to keep his teaching fresh and engaging.\nWith a strong focus on practical application, Peter encourages his students to participate in various challenges and competitions, providing them with opportunities to extend their learning beyond the classroom. Overall, Peter’s innovative approach and enthusiasm in teaching makes him an excellent role model and mentor for students seeking to achieve their full potential.\n(Citation by ICT Evaluation Committee Member)\nDr Tan Bhing Leet\nBhing Leet uses a flipped-classroom approach to encourage students to use contact time to clarify doubts, rather than to receive knowledge. She has a clear teaching philosophy based on relevant educational theories.\nThrough her research endeavours and connections with healthcare services, Bhing Leet ensures that her curriculum is up to date to industry needs. She supports a wide range of modules but will always create time for students to understand the issues they face and provide support. By providing formative feedback on students' work and non-graded assignments, Bhing Leet reduces the stress on students but still provides extra learning opportunities. She has redesigned a module by incorporating non-graded interactive materials to encourage deeper learning. She utilises data analytics to identify struggling students and challenge the more advanced ones.\n(Citation by HSS Evaluation Committee Member)"
