    "From doubt to distinction: The impact of mentorship and support",
    "BCA Scholar and Tan Chin Tuan Scholar Firdaus Laza shares how mentorship and scholarship support has transformed his life, guiding him towards self-belief and success.",
    "26 March 2025",
    "Sometimes, all it takes is for someone to believe in you. And that can be life-changing.",
    "“If it wasn’t for the encouragement and support from my secondary school form teacher Madam Raudzah Osman, I wouldn’t be here today,”",
    "shares Mr Muhammad Firdaus Bin Fawzi Laza. “When I told her I wanted to quit school, she encouraged me to at least complete my ‘N’ levels.\"",
    "He did, passing the examinations and acing the Math paper, shocking himself and Madam Raudzah. Today, the SIT alumnus is a Senior Manager with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).",
    "A nudge towards self-belief and excellence",
    "However, his journey was far from a fairy tale. It was only when he enrolled in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) that he had an epiphany. Realising that he could excel if he believed in himself, he decided to focus on his studies, even though he disliked it. From a student who used to daydream in class and skip school, Mr Firdaus became one who never missed his lectures and always sat right at the front.",
    "He did well to get into Temasek Polytechnic to pursue a Diploma in Electronics Engineering where he achieved a near-perfect GPA of 3.88 and graduated with a Diploma with Merit, awarded to the top 10 percent of the cohort. His stellar academic achievements continued at SIT. Not only did he graduate with Honours with Highest Distinction in the Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Power Engineering, a joint degree programme with Newcastle University, but he was also the top student of the entire cohort. He was further recognised with the Institution of Engineering and Technology Prize Award, MENDAKI Excellence Award and the Special Achievement Award for Excellence (Academic).",
    "For the former Normal (Academic) student, these achievements were beyond his and his mother’s wildest imagination, but they did not come without struggles.",
    "In reality, affording a university education was out of reach. While in ITE and polytechnic, he worked part-time to support his family’s finances. With university tuition fees alone nearing $9,000 annually, the cost would have been a significant burden for his family, who at times endured power supply cuts due to unpaid electricity bills for their three-room HDB flat.",
    "A tuition teacher during his secondary school days, Mr Shaifudin Bin Ibrahim (or Shai) was another important mentor in his life. Even when his family could no longer afford to pay him, Shai, recognising his progress, continued to tutor him pro bono and provided guidance whenever needed.",
    "I had a few job offers and considered working full-time to help my family. At the same time, I had offers from universities, but I was worried that I might not perform as well as I did in Polytechnic. Shai reassured me that my family was not expecting me to contribute financially and encouraged me to continue my studies,\" says Mr Firdaus.",
    "An incredible journey to learning beyond the classroom, Mr Firdaus (first row, rightmost) with his classmates at Newcastle, England for his Overseas Immersion Programme.",
    "Scholarships helped him achieve his goal",
    "The Tan Chin Tuan Foundation, which has been supporting outstanding SIT students in need of financial help since 2017, was also convinced of his determination to succeed and awarded him the Tan Sri (Dr) Tan Chin Tuan Scholarship to support his academic pursuit.",
    "\"During the COVID-19 period, Ms Yap Su-Yin, then the Foundation's CEO, checked in periodically on how I was doing, even though I was on the scholarship for just a year,\" shares Mr Firdaus, grateful for the Foundation's support.",
    "He secured a BCA Scholarship the following year which covered the remainder of his course and also sponsored his Master of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at SIT in 2020. These scholarships enabled him to receive an applied learning education at SIT, equipping him with real-world experiences and skills that have prepared him well for his current role in at BCA.",
    "These days, he attends courses on sustainability and artificial intelligence to expand his knowledge and skills. Now wiser, he also recognises the importance of acquiring skills that strengthen and energise both the industry and the wider community.",
    "Mr Firdaus (first row, second from left) with fellow SITizens and Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC Constituency MPs (Senior Minister Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister of State Dr Janil Puthucheary and Minister of State Ms Sun Xueling) at the launch of the Punggol Digital District on 21 January, 2018.",
    "The power of mentorship",
    "Mr Firdaus still feels that he has a lot of catching up to be on par with his peers but acknowledges that the hard work was worth it.",
    "\"When I was younger, I thought that I was doing this for my parents. Growing up, I realised that it was actually for myself,\" he reveals. \"Having a mentor to guide you in choosing your path, what to study and how to move forward really helps.\"",
    "Whenever he can, he never hesitates to return to give back by sharing his experiences with students, hoping to motivate and encourage them in their learning journeys.",
    "For those who may feel lost or are struggling, mentors like Madam Raudzah, Shai and Ms Yap could be just around the corner, ready to support you and guide you in the right direction. Believe in yourself and never give up.",
    "\"There are no shortcuts to anywhere worth going,\" says Mr Firdaus.",
