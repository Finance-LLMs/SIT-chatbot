    "The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) has set the target for the harbour craft and pleasure craft sectors to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, aligning with the national climate ambition.",
    "From 2030, all new harbour craft will be required to be fully electric, capable of using pure biodiesel (B100), or compatible with net-zero fuels like hydrogen. It is expected that most of the 1,600 harbour craft in Singapore's waters will opt for electrification. As the maritime industry prepares for this transition, the launch of an advanced programme on the electrification of marine vessels becomes timely and essential.",
    "This course is designed to equip professionals with the knowledge of key components, the design process, and considerations for hybrid or full electric ships and shore charging systems. Upon completion of this course, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of how load demand profiles, energy sources, and the power distribution system work together in a hybrid or full electric plug-in ship. Additionally, you will learn about the key differences between shore and shipboard electrical installations and become aware of potential challenges for shore-to-ship charging.",
