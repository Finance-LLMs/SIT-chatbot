A very warm welcome to all of you tonight as we celebrate the\nSingapore Institute of Technology's 10th anniversary as an\nAutonomous University. All of you, in one way or another, have\nsupported us on this journey and we are grateful that you have\ntaken the time to commemorate this special occasion with us.\nSPEECH\n2\nSIT’s Decade of Impact  & Growth\n2. 10 years ago, we embarked on a journey fuelled  by a clear vision:\nto be a university of applied learning, dedicated to nurturing\nfuture -ready graduates able to contribute meaningfully to\nSingapore's growth and development.\n3. Over the past decade , SIT has grown significantly , achiev ed\nseveral milestones  and positively impact ed our students and\nindustry  partners . From admitting about 1,800 students in 2014,\nwe now admit over 3,300, making us the A utonomous University\nwith the third -largest full -time undergraduate student intake.\nThe graduates we produce, our SITizens, are well -received by the\nindustry.  Graduate Employment Surveys over the last few years\nnot only show that the overall employment rate has consistently\nexceeded  90%, one in two graduates received advanced job\noffers from their Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP)\ncompanies .\n4. The IWSP is a signature of an SIT degree . It integrat es meaningful\nwork experience into the degree programme. Since the IWSP\nwas launched in January 2015, close to 8,000  students have gone\n3\nthrough the programme. From 11 partner companies in 2015, we\nhave grown this number to 884 partner  companies today. Over\nthe years,  some employers have even recognise d IWSP as the\nfirst year of work , giving our SITizen s second -year  seniority upon\njoining the company after graduation . I am heartened  that our\ngraduates are strongly valued by employers.  And their\nachievements are even more heart -warming  when you consider\nthe fact that about half of our students are the first in their\nfamil ies to attend university. SIT has certainly made university\neducation more accessible and enhanced the social mobility of\nmany.\n5. Our donors have been instrumental in helping us make\nuniversity education more accessible . They have established\nclose to 1,000 donor funds at SIT over the past decade . These\nhave enabl ed us to award over  9,100 scholarships, bursaries and\nstudy grants since 2014 , which have helped alleviate financial\nburdens and e nabled  many talented students to pursue their\neducation at SIT.\n6. Amongst our esteemed donors present tonight are Ms. Carolyn\nChoo, CEO and Managing Director  of Worldwide Hotels, Dr. Chua\nThian Poh, Mr. Soo Ye Wah, Executive Chairman  of Dou Yee\n4\nEnterprises, Mrs Wong Kwok  Leong , as well as representatives of\nCity Developments Limited , The Estate of Lim Doa Hin  and The\nNgee Ann Kongsi. We are deeply appreciative of their generosity\nand their belief in our mission.\nExpanding Our Mission Beyond PET\n7. In recent years, SIT’s  mission has expanded . We have moved\nbeyond Pre -Employment Training to Continuing Education and\nTraining . To do this, we continuously develop new educational\npathways to better address the needs of our learners and the\nindustry . Our latest educational innovation is the Competency -\nbased Stackable Micro -credential (or CSM) pathway , which\noffers learners the flexibility to acquire in -demand skills through\nindividual micro -credentials, which if the learner so wish es, can\nbe stack ed to a degree. This not only allows the learner to\nquickly apply their newly acquired skills to the workplace, but\nalso attain higher education  credentials .\n8. As with all of SIT's programmes, the curriculum for the CSM\npathway is developed together with industry. Our latest\ncollaboration is with Singtel  on its Regional Sustainable Data\n5\nCentre Academy , which will be launched in the middle of this\nyear. T ogether with Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic,\nTemasek Polytechnic and the Institute of Technical Education , we\nwill train talent in new areas of data centre development such as\nsustainability and high -density A rtificial Intelligence\nenvironments .\n9. To stay relevant, our education is informed with the learnings\nand outputs from our applied research.  Since ramping up\nresearch in 2020, we have  inked more than  150 applied research -\nrelated agreements with industry partners . In the food -tech\nspace for example,  we have  worked with food companies to\nleverage technology for Alternative Protein development and\nwaste valorisation. The close nexus between our applied\nresearch and education strengthens our ability to deliver an\nindustry -focused, applied learning education for our learners,\nand an impactful applied research approach for our industry\npartners.\nNew  Home , New Horizons – Stronger Together in Punggol\n10. As many of you know, we have been building our new campus in\nPunggo l. We will be moving to our new home later this year . Our\n6\nPunggol campus will see the coming together of our current six\nlocations . This convening  of all our SITizens, academic clusters,\nand applied research and innovation centres, allows us to not\nonly deepen multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teaching and\nlearning, but to better provide a holistic education for our\nSITizens.\nStronger Ties within the SITizen Community\n11. We also envision our Punggol campus to be  a welcoming space\nfor our alumni to further connect  with us  and forge lasting\nconnections with fellow SITizens. One way we hope for our\nalumni to return is through our ‘Learn for Life’  initiative launched\nlast year . It allow s SITizens to read one CET module for free, once\nevery five years . From opportunities for upskilling and reskilling,\nto facilities  such as a playing field, dance studios, and meaningful\nhome -coming activities , reasons abound for alumni to come\nback home.  Alumni are a key part of our SIT community . Our\nhope is  for them to foster relationships with their juniors  so that\nwe can  develop  a supportive and collaborative learning\ncommunity , especially in this era of lifelong learning .\nForging Stronger Ties with Industry\n7\n12. With our new campus situated in the exciting Punggol Digital\nDistrict , SIT will also be plug ged into a vibrant ecosystem for\ninnovation and collaboration .  We will capitalise on the real -\nworld systems of our campus Living Labs and those of our\npartners to catalyse authentic learning experiences and applied\nresearch.  Living Labs  foster  a dynamic learning environment\nwhere students can apply their knowledge to real -world\nchallenges . They also provid e a fertile ground for impactful\nresearch , allowing the University , industry, and government\npartners to jointly develop, test and deploy research ideas .\n13. Just this afternoon,  we inked a Memorandum of Underst anding\nwith SBS Transit, which will see the Punggol Coast MRT station ,\nwhich is at  the doorstep of our Punggol campus become  our\nlatest  Living Lab. The entire MRT station will be turned into a\ndigital twin platform for students and academic staff to use as a\nlearning and research facility to help address emerging\nchallenges and leverage opportunities to drive innovation in the\npublic transport industry . Beyond that, the public spaces in the\nMRT station will be event spaces where our students’\nperformances and exhibitions can be held.  All in, Punggol Coast\nMRT station promises to be a hive of activity, where innovation ,\ncreativity and passion thrive .\n8\nGrowing Partnerships and Innovation for the Future\n14. In Punggol, we would also like to build a strong connection with\nthe local  community.  One initiative in the works is the\ndevelopment of a model for engaged learning.  Here, we intend\nto work with secondary schools in Punggol to scale up  and grow\nbeyond  our annual Community Challenge to solve real-life\nproblems using Science, Technology, Engineering and Math or\nSTEM skills. Through hands -on activities , secondary school\nstudents  will get the opportunity to hone their design thinking\nskills, apply their STEM skills , and witness the positive impact\ntheir work can have.  Our SITizen s, who  work with and mentor\nthe teens , also get to hone their leadership and facilitation skills,\nand reinforce their own learning. The challenge  exemplifies our\ncommitment to education that is grounded in the community .\n15. Another initiative is to e xpan d our Punggol community\noutreach . We are looking at  leveraging the expertise of our\nacademic clusters to become a knowledge hub for the Punggol\nregion, by offer ing enriching and practical workshops and talks\nfor the public.  For example, our  Health and Social Sciences\ncluster is planning to jointly host Allied Health talks  with local\n9\nmedical institutions and even establish public physiotherapy\nclinics . Our Business, Communication, and Design cluster will be\norgani sing financial literacy workshops  to empower individuals\nand families.\nCharting the course: Vision 2034\n16. Looking ahead to the next decade , we have embarked on  a\ncomprehensive visioning exercise, both internally and with key\nexternal stakeholders like yourselves. This exercise aims to  seek\nperspectives on how SIT can further contribute to Singapore’s\neconomy and society.  We expect to conclude this exercise and\nlaunch our 2034 vision by the official opening of our Punggol\ncampus next year.\n17. As we stand here tonight, on the cusp of a new chapter, we\nreflect with immense gratitude for your unwavering support\nthroughout our journey.  This journey  and its milestones  have\nbeen captured in a commemorative book . \"Journey to Punggol\"\nchronicles our humble beginnings, our commitment to\nexcellence, and the many individuals who have contributed to\nour success. We would like to  present you with this book as a\ntoken of appreciation for being a part of our story.\n10\n18. Once again, I humbly  thank each and every one of you for\nwalking with us on this journey . We look forward to your\ncontinued support as we evolve to meet the changing needs of\nour learners, industry,  and c ommunity , to become a premier\nuniversity of applied learning . One that has individuals, industry\nand innovation at its core. A university that lives and breathes\nwith industry and community and contributes to Singapore and\nSingaporeans.\n19. Thank you."
