  "content": "After her mother was diagnosed\nwith mild dementia in 2022, Ms\nWinnie Lee felt helpless and at a\nloss when it came to taking care of\nher.\nHer 74-year-old mother forgets\nthings such as the date and time,\nand asks the same questions re-\npeatedly.\n“I got frustrated easily and we\noften got into arguments. I found it\ndifficult to understand and accept\nhow she would forget things that\nshe would not in the past,” says Ms\nLee, a 40-year-old manager in the\ninfocommunications and technol-\nogy sector.\nThe elderly woman also lost in-\nterest in her favourite activities,\nsuch as cooking and gardening.\nDementia is a brain disorder that\ninterferes with one’s ability to\ncarry out daily activities. It encom-passes a range of dysfunctions\nsuch as severe memory loss and\nmood and behavioural changes.\nAs Ms Lee was searching for sup-\nport online, she came across work-\nshops by social service agency\nDementia Singapore’s caregiver\nsupport group.\nAs part of the workshops, she\nstepped into the shoes of a person\nliving with dementia using a vir-\ntual reality (VR) application called\nEducational Dementia Immersive\nExperience (Edie).\nThe app, developed by Dementia\nAustralia in 2016 and introduced in\nSingapore in 2019, was designed to\nbuild empathy and make people\nmore aware of the issues faced by\nthose living with the condition.\nIt explores what it may feel like\ntoexperiencedementiaandtocare\nfor someone living with it, as well\nas identifies areas for support.\nParticipants wear VR headsets\nand earphones to enable them to\nsee and hear through the eyes and\nears of a man in his early 60s who\nhas dementia while his wife takes\ncare of him.\nParticipants are involved in sce-\nnarios such as helping him find his\nway to the toilet in the early hours\nof the morning when it is dark. In\nanother instance, they are shown\nhow the man mistakes the laundry\nbasket for the toilet bowl and uri-\nnates in it.\nAfter Ms Lee tried Edie as part of\nafreesix-weekworkshopinJuneat\nDementia Singapore in Bende-meer, she had a deeper under-\nstandingofhermother’scondition.\n“I was surprised and shocked to\nsee her world. I realised she was\nnot trying to be difficult. I became\na lot more compassionate and un-\nderstanding towards her,” she says.\nAfter the VR experience, she\nmodified their home environment\nso her mother could easily move\naround and identify objects.\nForinstance,sheboughtasimple\nclockthatshowedthenumbersina\nbig bold font. She also installed au-\ntomatic light sensors that illumi-\nnate the path from her mother’s\nbedroom to the toilet, so she can\neasily navigate at night.According to Singapore’s health\nportal HealthHub, one in10 people\nabove the age of 60 here suffers\nfrom dementia. This corresponds\ntoabout82,000peoplein2018and\nthenumberisprojectedtoincrease\nto 152,000 by 2030.\nDementiaimpactsnotonlythose\ndiagnosed with the condition, but\ntheir caregivers as well.\nAjointstudyof1,500peoplecon-\nducted in July by Dementia Singa-\npore and Milieu Insight, a con-\nsumer research firm in South-east\nAsia, found that 74 per cent of\ncaregiversofpeoplewithdementia\nwere overwhelmed by their res-\nponsibilities.\nThey said their biggest hurdles\nwere the emotional and mental\nstrains of caregiving. These in-\nclude managing behavioural\nchanges, navigating emotional\nstress and burnout, and coping\nwith the gradual decline of their\nloved ones.\nMs Dorine Lee, a training man-\nageratDementiaSingaporeAcade-\nmy, says much can be done to raise\nawareness of dementia and reduce\nthestigmaassociatedwiththecon-\ndition.\n“We ultimately want healthcare\nprofessionals and members of the\npublic to gain a deeper under-\nstandingofdementiatobettersup-\nport people living with it and en-\ngage them in everyday activities,”\nshe says.\nDementia Singapore Academy is\nthe training and consultancy armof Dementia Singapore. It provides\ntraining programmes for profes-\nsionals, family caregivers and for-\neign domestic workers, as well as\nconsultancy services for agencies\nproviding dementia care services.\nEdie helps healthcare profes-\nsionals and the public, including\ncaregivers, better understand de-\nmentia. The workshop by Demen-\ntia Singapore, which runs for three\nhours for the public and 3½ hours\nfor community organisations,\ncosts $129.60 and $142.88 respec-\ntively.\nResearchers from the Singapore\nInstitute of Technology (SIT) also\nstepped in to study the ways it im-\nproved one’s perception of people\nwith dementia.\nSIT Associate Professor and As-\nsistant Provost of Applied Learn-\ning May Lim says 61 participants,\nincluding caregivers and health-\ncare professionals, were recruited\nin 2020 to try Edie and share their\nexperiences.\nThe use of the VR application\n“contributed to improvements in\nknowledge, attitudes and empath-\netic responses”.\nProf Lim shares that one partici-\npant, a 46-year-old nurse, empath-\nised with people with dementia\nmore after undergoing the VR ex-\nperience,saying:“Theirvisionisso\ndistorted. It makes things around\nthem look scary, and they feel\nscared.”\nI was surprised and\nshocked to see her\nworld. I realised she\nwas not trying to be\ndifficult. I became\na lot more\ncompassionate and\nunderstanding\ntowards her.\n”MS WINNIE LEE, whose mother has\ndementia, on trying the Educational\nDementia Immersive Experience\nvirtual reality applicationSingapore\nInstitute of\nTechnology\nAssociate\nProfessor May\nLim (standing)\ntrying the\nExperience\nDementia in\nSingapore virtual\nreality simulation\nof a person with\ndementia.\nST PHOTO:\nAZMI ATHNI\nCONTINUED on C2Immersive virtual reality\nexperience can help people\nempathise more with those\nliving with dementia\nAmrita KaurCome into my worldPublication: The Straits Times\nDate: 25 Oct 2023\nHeadline: Come into my world\ne\nExperience dementia\nin Singapore context\nProf Lim says there was feedback\nsuggesting a Singaporean context\nfor the VR scenarios and for these\nto span community and home set-\ntings.\nMs Lee adds that Dementia Sin-\ngapore also saw the need to pro-\nvide a more relatable experience\nfor users here.\nThe social service agency, with\nsupport from The Majurity Trust,\nAgency for Integrated Care and\nSIT, hence developed Experience\nDementia in Singapore (Edis).
