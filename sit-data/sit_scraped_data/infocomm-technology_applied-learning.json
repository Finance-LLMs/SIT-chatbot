    "Our teaching pedagogy is geared towards inculcating skills useful for the industry of today and tomorrow, and is enriched by a high degree of application via extensive industry attachments.",
    "We aim to be a leader in innovative university education in the ICT space by integrating learning, industry and community.",
    "Our industry component is ensured by our faculty engaging with industry on applied research projects, often with the active involvement of students. Our students also spend substantial time in the industry during their IWSP (Integrated Work Study Programme) which lasts between 8 and 12 months, and for industry modules such as ITP (integrative team project).",
    "Meanwhile, we engage many industry experts to teach parts of our specialised modules to ensure that students (and staff) always know exactly what is happening in the industry, but also so that they can see what they are learning from an industry perspective.",
    "Our teaching pedagogy, backed up by extensive educational training and the best teaching resources, is cutting edge and gives weight to our aim of being the premier university of applied learning. Graduates from SIT earn excellent salaries and are typically highly employable. For these reasons we are a popular choice for students, and we would hope to be their go-to resource for lifelong learning, as they navigate their future careers, with our range of industry training courses and higher degrees at masters and doctorate levels.",
