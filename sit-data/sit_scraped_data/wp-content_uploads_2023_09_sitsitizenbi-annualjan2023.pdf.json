For Singapore Institute of Technology\n(SIT) students, it is shaping up with exciting possibilities at\nSIT’s future campus in Punggol, as well as a flurry of innovative\nacademic and research developments.\nIn this issue, we unveil The Ngee Ann Kongsi Library in\nPunggol, a state-of-the art facility made possible by the\nKongsi’s $25-million philanthropic commitment, the largest\nthat SIT has received to date. SIT’s Punggol campus will\nalso boast the first Multi-Energy Microgrid (MEMG) on a\nuniversity campus in Southeast Asia, as well as the largest\nprivate microgrid in Singapore – which is being developed in\npartnership with the SP Group to support the nation’s energy\ntransition for a low-carbon energy future.\nLocated in the Punggol Digital District, a seedbed of daring\nideas and ground-breaking R&D, SIT’s upcoming campus in\nPunggol will indeed be one that SITizens can look forward to –\na vibrant living lab where academia and industry will be tightly\nintegrated with the community, one that is designed to mould\nthem into work-ready professionals of the future.\nIn other developments, SIT and ENGIE have announced a\npartnership to advance district cooling across Southeast Asia.\nThis symbiotic collaboration will enable applied research,\nauthentic learning spaces for SIT students, co-development\nof curriculum content, as well as knowledge sharing sessions\nfor industry and community. The university has also launched\nSingapore’s first competency-based stackable micro-credential\npathway to provide upgrading pathways for in-employment\nlearners, starting with the Bachelor of Science with Honours in\nApplied Computing degree programme.\nSIT graduates are also doing well. More than 9 in 10 SITizens\nfrom the Class of 2021 were employed within six months of\ngraduation, and 86% were employed in full-time permanent\njobs, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. They also earned a\nmean gross monthly salary of $3,355 and a median gross\nmonthly salary of $3,550, both competitive numbers. Their\njuniors, the Class of 2022, the 10th and largest cohort that\nSIT has graduated to date, became the very first to launch an\nannual class giving drive to support their juniors through the\nSIT Bursary. Certainly, SIT’s Faculty & Staff had led the way in\nsupporting this bursary as well as other causes, most recently\nin July 2022, with the return of the Faculty & Staff Giving\nRoadshow.\nIn the pages to follow, you will find these stories and more.

At SIT’s\nfuture Punggol campus, the\nLibrary is designed to facilitate What’s Up Punggol?\nthe interaction of people and ideas\nand meet students’ diverse learning\nneeds.\nIt will have technology-enabled\ncollaborative learning spaces,\nwhere students can get hands-on\nexposure to state-of-the-art digital\nequipment and technologies. They\nwill be able to learn collaboratively\nto enhance their learning outside\nof class time. For example, the\nLibrary will house discussion pods\nfor group consultations, rooms to\nrehearse and record presentations,\ndigital hives equipped with higher-\nend computers with specialised\nsoftware, as well as an immersive\nmedia studio.\n6The Library will also be a testbed\nto support projects that students\ncan work on as part of their\npractical learning. The Ngee Ann\nKongsi Library will continue to\ncreate purposeful programmes\nand projects to bring together\nstudents, faculty, industry partners\nand community members from all\ndisciplines to learn together.\nIt will develop larger scale\nprogrammes to enhance\nstudent competencies, such as\na distinguished speaker series\nfeaturing industry practitioners and\ncommunity leaders. The Library’s\nlocation in Punggol will allow it to\nplay a role in the building of strong\ncommunities, by enabling service\nlearning for SIT students through\ntheir engagement with the\nPunggol community.\nAt the naming ceremony, Professor\nChua Kee Chaing, President, SIT,\nsaid, “On behalf of SIT, I would\nlike to express our heartfelt\nappreciation to The Ngee Ann\nKongsi for its generous and wide-\nranging support of SIT students\nthrough the years. Since 2017, the\nKongsi has been supporting a\nscholarship, a gold medal, and\nan emergency relief fund for our\nstudents.”\n“Now, with this transformative\ngift, it will offer our students\naccess to more exciting learning\nopportunities – through an\nemergence fund and a library\nfor the future – to help them\nhone their capabilities for the\nknowledge economy. One of\nSIT’s cherished aspirations is\nto nurture graduates who are\npassionate about serving the\ncommunity, and we are very\ngrateful for this gift,” he added.\nSaid Mr Jamie Teo, Vice-President\nand Chairman of the Donation\n& Charity Sub-Committee, The\nNgee Ann Kongsi, “We are very\nhonoured by the naming of\nThe Ngee Ann Kongsi Library\nat SIT. The Ngee Ann Kongsi\nfirmly believes in empowerment\nthrough education.

It will supply\nmore than 2000 MWh of electricity\nannually from photovoltaic solar\npanels, equating to 4% of the total\nenergy needs of the campus. The microgrid is customised for\nSingapore’s tropical climate and will\nprovide a sandbox environment to\ntestbed Singapore’s future energy\nsystem while minimising risks of\ndisruptions to operations. It will be\nable to integrate electricity, thermal\nand renewable sources of energy\ninto a unified smart energy network,\nto support applied learning,\nresearch and experimentation in a\nreal-world environment.\nWith the new investment, the\nmicrogrid will be enhanced to\nintegrate various low-carbon\nsolutions including building-\nintegrated photovoltaics and\ndistributed energy storage systems.\nSIT and SP will also design a system\nthat can further island buildings\nand certain floors from the\nnational grid. The enhanced\nmicrogrid will also boast a hybrid\nAC (Alternating Current)/DC (Direct\nCurrent) building level grid and\nwill allow for different building\nmanagement systems to be tested\nand deployed.With the enhanced functionality,\nthe campus’ MEMG will be a\nmicrocosm of Singapore’s future\nenergy system, supporting:\n• technology and policy research\nin support of an increasingly\ndistributed national grid with\nboth AC/DC sub-systems, and\nvarious forms of distributed\ngrid architecture and microgrid\ncontrollers to optimise for cost,\nresilience and carbon;\n• next-generation power\nelectronics to facilitate\nincreasing bidirectional grid\npower flows; and\n• innovative energy services to\ncater to the needs of different\nconsumer segments.\nProf Chua Kee Chaing, SIT\nPresident, said: “We are pleased\nthat our collaboration with SP\nGroup over the past few years has\nmatured to a stage where we can\nexplore new ground in areas that\nwill help Singapore address issues\nof energy resilience and energy\nmanagement. This augurs well for\nthe country as we approach a future\nthat is increasingly going to rely on\nsustainable and green sources of\nenergy.”\nAs a university of applied learning,\nSIT places priority on authentic\nlearning, bringing real problems\ninto the classroom. The MEMG\ntakes this idea further, bringing the\nclassroom out into the world.\nThe microgrid will be a platform\nfor interdisciplinary research in\nemerging energy technologies,\ncyber security, sustainable\ninfrastructure, and green building\ndesigns involving students from\nEngineering and Infocomm\nTechnology. For industry, the\nmicrogrid provides a high-fidelity\nsystem to experiment, innovate\nand develop the technologies and\npolicies that would support the\nenergy transition.\nThis article first appeared in SIT’s\nDigital Newsroom.An artistic rendering of the East Zone in SIT’s upcoming Punggol campus.\nWhat’s Up Punggol?\n8\nMoulding SIT Students into Work-Ready\nProfessionals at Punggol Digital District\nThe Punggol Digital District (PDD), home to renowned and upcoming technology\nplayers, serves as a seedbed of daring ideas and ground-breaking R&D. SIT’s upcoming\ncentralised campus in PDD will feature a vibrant learning environment where academia\nand industry will be tightly integrated with the community\nAs the country’s first university\nof applied learning, Singapore\nInstitute of Technology’s\n(SIT) pedagogy is not just the\nconventional blend of lectures\nand laboratory-based research.\nIts industry-relevant degree\nprogrammes are anchored\non authentic learning and\nexperimentation in real-world\nenvironments. In the programmes,\nstudents work on problems and\ncreate solutions that address\npressing industry needs.\nJTC’s Punggol Digital District\n(PDD) thus makes an ideal campus\nlocation for SIT to fully implement\nits applied learning pedagogy.\nHome to renowned and upcoming\ntechnology players, the district\nserves as a seedbed of daring\nideas and ground-breaking\nresearch and development (R&D).\nBeing nestled in this community of\nestablished tech companies and\nstart-ups means that SIT’s students\nand faculty can keep pace with\nthe latest industry happenings,\nand even be fresh pairs of eyes, providing inputs that could\novercome bottlenecks and birth\nbreakthroughs.\nAnd the benefits of this co-location\ngo both ways. Whenever company\npersonnel need innovative ideas\nor wish to reskill or upskill their\nworkers, they can stroll across\nthe walkway and tap into the\nuniversity’s resources through\nresearch collaborations or pick the\nbrains of academic staff with deep\nexpertise and experience across\nvarious industries and disciplines.\nTheir staff can also participate\nin many upskilling programmes\nto support industry workforce\ntransformation.\nFurthermore, PDD is backed by a\nsmart estate management system\ncalled the Open Digital Platform\n(ODP), a key component of which\nis a digital twin. Streams of district-\nlevel data are fed to the cyber-\nphysical replica of PDD, making it\na living lab where companies can\ntest-bed their solutions with zero\nrisks. SIT students can partner with\n8At SIT’s upcoming campus @ PDD, businesses can look forward to a collaborative environment that fosters industry-academia partnerships.\nPhoto courtesy of JTC.\nthese companies to co-engineer\napplications in emerging sectors\nsuch as artificial intelligence,\nrobotics, blockchain, cybersecurity,\nand smart living.\n“Living Labs are a strategic\nimperative to SIT. It is a way to\nembody our education and\nresearch focus — moving away from\nlectures and lab-based research\nand towards authentic learning\nand experimentation in a real-\nlife environment. Whether within\nSIT’s facilities or in partnership\nwith PDD, living labs provide an\nopportunity for SIT and industry\npartners to develop and showcase\nnew business models, jobs,\ninvestments, and partnerships,”\nsays SIT President Professor Chua\nKee Chaing. “At the same time,\nprojects rolled out via the PDD\nliving lab programme will provide\nnew insights for government\nagencies to develop technical and\npolicy frameworks to support the\nadoption of innovations.”\n9\nLearning Beyond the Book\nWell ahead of PDD’s official\nopening in 2024, the university is\nalready knee-deep in collaborating\nwith industry players. One of it is\ndConstruct, a local start-up that\nprides itself on creating autonomous\nsolutions that make robots smarter\nand at the same time easier to use.\nThe two entities are looking to create\nself-driving robotic solutions that\nimprove campus experiences such as\nlast-mile delivery and smart campus\nmanagement. Technologies being\ndeveloped include autonomous\nscanning — where robots scan and\nconstruct digital twins of facilities like\na campus with minimal intervention.\nBy working with dConstruct’s\nproprietary software programming\ntool and and agile mobile robots,\nSIT students will get to go beyond\nputting pen to paper, and craft\nsolutions that have real-world impact.\nCrowdsourcing Ideas\nthrough Joint Challenges\nAlong with JTC and digital media\ncompany Target Media Culcreative\n(TMCC), SIT recently organised\nthe “Beyond the Screen Ideation\nChallenge”, which aimed to shape\nthe future of communication in PDD\nby using digital screens to engage\naudiences, connect people, and\nform communities. The winning\nentry from an SIT student centres on\na repository comprising a directory\nof nearby amenities, wayfinding,\nweather forecasts, and community\nnews. There is even an entertainment\nfunction where one can play a quick\ngame of tic-tac-toe with other users.\nThe other winning submission,\nwhich comes from the community,\naims to utilise digital screens to help\nPDD’s tenants and visitors keep their fingers on the pulse of environmental\nsustainability. Up-to-date\nenvironmental news, seasonal foods\nthat promote sustainable eating and\ngreen tips are among the information\nthat will be showcased on the digital\nbulletin. These proposals are now\nbeing considered for implementation\nwhen PDD opens.\nMaking Industry\nCollaborations Engaging\nAnother successful partnership\nis the Bug Bounty 1.0 and 2.0\nprogrammes, which saw participation\nfrom SIT, JTC, global cybersecurity\ncompany Group-IB, cybersecurity\nindustry association Division Zero,\nand the Cybersecurity Agency of\nSingapore.\nThe programme allowed anyone\nworking or interested in cybersecurity\nto test his or her hacking skills on\nreal systems, identifying bugs and\nvulnerabilities, thereby enabling\nauthentic learning.\nHeld over two years in July 2021\nand August 2022, participants were\ninvited to hack into two systems\nfor the Bug Bounty programme — a\nsmart lighting system and a mini-\nBMS system. It is a win-win situation:\nstudents could test their skills on real-\nworld systems while cybersecurity\ncompanies could identify\nand address these vulnerabilities.\nSystem owners also benefitted from a\nstrengthened operating system.\nFacilitating Learning in\nActual Work Environments\nBesides collaborative initiatives,\nSIT also provides students and\nprofessionals with platforms to hone\ntheir skills, while also delivering\nbenefits and results to companies\nin PDD that participate in these joint efforts. Its Integrated Work Study\nProgramme (IWSP) and work-study\nscheme enable a mix of work\nand study, integrating institution-\nbased learning with structured\non-the-job training. The IWSP\ngives undergraduates a valuable\nopportunity to transition into their\nfuture jobs. For companies in PDD,\nthese arrangements also allow\nthem to scout for and secure talent\nwith the skills needed to make\nan immediate impact on their\nbusinesses.\nThe living labs will also be\ninstrumental in boosting students’\nwork readiness. Already, one such\nliving lab is materialising. In July\n2022, ENGIE, a global leader in low\ncarbon energy and services, signed\na Memorandum of Understanding\n(MoU) with SIT to jointly develop\na District Cooling System (DCS)\nCentre of Excellence.\nThe ENGIE-SIT District Cooling\nSystem Centre of Excellence will\nserve as a training ground for SIT\nstudents to learn about DCS and\naspects of maintenance and energy\nefficiency in real-world conditions.\nThe centre is an extension of the\ncampus’ learning environment,\ncomplementing the collaborative\nresearch in cold thermal storage,\nair-side cooling distribution\nsystems and cooling load\nmanagement. Students, in turn,\nwill acquire skillsets in data-driven\noptimisation, DCS decarbonisation\nand predictive maintenance. Local\nwork attachment and commercial\nDCS development opportunities\nwith ENGIE’s entities will also be\noffered through the IWSP .\nThese collaborations exemplify\nSIT’s efforts to adapt and change in\nan era of disruption. And being at\nPDD gives it a unique advantage\nwhere it can ensure that its\ncurriculum and research projects\nare relevant and support the needs\nof ever-evolving industries.\nThis article was first published by JTC.\nJTC is a government agency under\nSingapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry\nthat champions sustainable industrial\ndevelopment.

Among them is Ms\nLim Wan Ting, a graduate from the\nBachelor of Science with Honours\nin Air Transport Management\n(SIT). She says: ““Being aware of\nmy own financial predicament as\na student, I am especially thankful\nand blessed to have SIT as a strong\nsupport system that is constantly championing my success through\nits various forms of financial\naids. While everyone is fighting\ntheir own tooth and nail to bring\nthemselves to where they are today,\na little bit of contribution can help\nease the struggles and adversities\nthat our fellow SITizens face. The\nability to give is a gift itself.”\nWilson Lee Kian Yi, a Class\nGiving Champion from SIT’s\nBachelor of Engineering with\nHonours in Telematics (Intelligent\nTransportation Systems\nEngineering) degree programme,\nsays: “During my journey in\nSIT, I had experienced financial\nproblems and SIT offered me\nsupport through the SIT Bursary\nand The Student Relief Fund at\nSIT (COVID-19).” He also says:\n“Remember that the happiest\npeople are not those getting more,\nbut those giving more. So, I hope\nmy contributing back can help\nprovide fellow SITizens with the\nsupport they need.”“$20.22 for 2022!” That call, made\nby 30 SITizens from this year’s\ngraduating class, is to encourage\ntheir peers to support Class Giving\n2022. The idea is to commemorate\ntheir graduation year by making\na gift of $20.22 to support the\nSIT Bursary for their juniors who\nare most in need of financial\naid. Valued at $3,000 each, the\nSIT Bursary will go some way in\ncovering the recipients’ living or\nstudy expenses.\nThanks to these Class Giving\nChampions, Class Giving 2022 has\nraised almost three SIT Bursaries\nfrom 221 donors thus far – and the\ncampaign is still ongoing.\nAt the graduation dinner held on\n15 October 2022, Professor Chua\nKee Chaing, President, SIT, said\nthat while the SIT Bursary had been\nsupported by SIT faculty and staff,\nas well as corporate and individual\ndonors since 2014, he was “very\nproud to see how the Class of 2022\nis trailblazing the tradition of Class\nGiving at SIT”.\n“Our graduates are young, and\ntheir resources are limited, so it is\nnot really how much they give that\nmatters. Rather, what is important\nis how they are coming forward to\nhelp ensure that the educational\nopportunities they have had at SIT\ncontinue to be within reach for their\n17\nSIT colleagues enjoying the beverages and\nthe local delights during the event.\nSIT faculty and staff have been supporting the Faculty & Staff Giving initiative at SIT since 2015.\nOur Hearts Take\nThem Further\nIn the first five months since the Faculty & Staff Giving\nRoadshow 2022, 57 SIT employees have together\nmade possible 21 SIT Bursaries for the new Academic\nYear, as well as supported the Student Relief Fund@SIT\n(COVID-19) and AdventureLearn\nOn 21 July 2022, close to 200\nSIT employees turned up at the\nAcademic Plaza at SIT@Dover to\nsupport the Faculty & Staff Giving\nRoadshow. This was the first time\nthat SIT faculty and staff were\nable to gather for the Roadshow\nsince the pandemic restrictions\nwere lifted and it was also an\nopportunity for them to meet with\nSIT Bursary recipients. Prof Chua\nKee Chaing, President, SIT, was\nalso present to show his support\nand speak with the recipients.\nDelicious local treats like laksa, roti\nprata and ice-cream sandwiches\nwere served during the cosy\nlunchtime event and staff also\ndelighted in playing childhood\ngames like snakes and ladders, five\nstones and chapteh.\nFinal-year Computer Science and\nGame Design student Chiang\nJun Ming, who received the SIT Prof Chua Kee Chaing, President, SIT, (fourth from left) together with some recipients of the\nSIT Bursary who showed up to thank the faculty and staff who nurture them.\nBursary in AY 2021/22, says the\nBursary enabled him to pay for\ninternet access when he needed\nto study or work from home, cover\neveryday expenses such as food\nand stationery, and “study with\nno worries”. He adds, “I hope to\nbe able to get a job I enjoy after\ngraduation and repay my parents\nfor supporting me.”Since the roadshow up to end\n2022, 57 colleagues had made\ngifts to support SIT students\nthrough the SIT Bursary, Student\nRelief Fund @ SIT (COVID-19)\nand AdventureLearn, a holistic\nstudent development platform\naimed at helping students learn\nbetter. Thanks to support from\nfaculty and staff, SIT will be able to\naward 21 SIT Bursaries (valued at\n$3,000 each) thus far to financially\ndisadvantaged students in this\nAcademic Year 2022/23 – and\ncounting – while also providing\nsupport for the other two funds. A\nround-the-year-effort kicked off by\nthe Roadshow, the Faculty & Staff\nGiving initiative is ongoing.\n17\n18SIT Launches Singapore’s First\nCompetency-based Stackable\nMicro-credential Pathway\nMoUs signed with NCS, Singtel, Singapore Computer\nSociety and three polytechnics to upskill and reskill ICT\nsector workforce\nThe Singapore Institute of\nTechnology (SIT) inked Memoranda\nof Understanding (MoUs) with\nthree industry partners and three\npolytechnics on 28 November 2022,\naimed at providing upgrading\npathways for in-employment learners.\nThey include NCS, Singtel, Singapore\nComputer Society, Nanyang\nPolytechnic, Singapore\nPolytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic.\nMr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for\nEducation, graced the MoU signing\nceremony held at the Arts House.\nThe collaborations will see\nthe university piloting a new\nCompetency-based Stackable Micro-\ncredential (CSM) pathway through\nits existing degree programme in\nBachelor of Science with Honours\nin Applied Computing tentatively\nin the later half of the academic\nyear 2023/2024. The CSM pathway\ncould be expanded to more degree\nprogrammes in future.\nEach micro-credential is attained\nthrough a short programme of\nstudy and/or workplace learning\nthat culminates with demonstrated\nmastery of competencies in a particular area. The CSM pathway\nis targeted at working adults who\nwould like to upskill or reskill\nthemselves while remaining in\nfull-time employment. This allows\nthem to acquire new competencies\nto take on larger roles in their\norganisations or pivot to emerging\ntechnologies.\nMinister Chan said, “The CSM is\nthe first of its kind to be offered\nthrough a collaboration between\nan Autonomous University in\nSingapore and the polytechnics.\nSuch just-in-time and flexible\nlearning supplements existing\nrecruitment, retention, and\nupskilling efforts – and will be key\nto the future of work. I hope more\nin-employment learners will be\nencouraged to take charge of their\nown lifelong learning journeys.”\nSIT President Professor Chua Kee\nChaing said, “CSM provides an\nalternative pathway for working\nadults to continually upgrade\nthemselves and stay relevant in the\nindustry. Offering micro-credentials\nthat are stackable towards a\ndegree fulfils many working adults’ aspiration for a university education\nwhile providing flexible learning for\nthem to attain competencies that\nbetter suit their job requirements or\nallow them to assume new job roles.\nThis will contribute to much needed\nworkforce transformation for industry,\nespecially for roles that require\ndeep technical skills such as artificial\nintelligence, cybersecurity, cloud\ncomputing and data analytics.”\nFeatures of the CSM Pathway\nThe micro-credentials offered under\nthe CSM pathway are organised\ninto competency blocks that cover\ncompetencies sought after by the\nindustry. They aim to enable learners\nto perform a new or higher-level job\nrole requiring greater competence.\nA typical micro-credential will take\naround four months to complete.\nThis modality of learning supports\nlifelong learning and encourages\nadult learners to take up short, just-\nin-time training.\nLearners can sign up for individual\nmicro-credentials as required for\ntheir work. Those who aspire to gain\na university education could stack\nup multiple micro-credentials and\ncomplete a capstone project to fulfil\nthe requirements of an SIT degree.\nWith the competency-based\napproach, learners not only gain the\nknowledge and skills of a domain,\nbut also gain the competence to\napply these at work.\nThe competency-based approach\nfacilitates the recognition of a\nlearner’s formal and informal prior\nlearning such as work experience,\nportfolios and industry certificates.\nSIT is in discussion with the\npolytechnics to align and recognise\nsome of their Advanced Diplomas\nand Specialist Diplomas as qualified\nmicro-credentials. More details will\nbe announced later.\nTo ensure industry relevance, SIT\nis working with Singtel and NCS to\ndesign the curriculum. SIT anticipates\nan initial cohort of close to 150\nlearners coming on board the CSM\npathway in support of workforce\ntransformation and training.\nThis article first appeared in SIT’s\nDigital Newsroom.\nKey representatives at the CSM pathway MoU signing ceremony on 28 November 2022.\nBack row: (From left) Mr Tan Wee Beng, Deputy Chief Executive (Operations and Regulation),\nSkillsFuture Singapore; Mr Bill Chang, Chairman, Board of Trustees, SIT; Mr Chan Chun Sing,\nMinister for Education; Prof Chua Kee Chaing, President, SIT; and Mr Terence Chia, Acting\nAssistant Chief Executive (Corporate), Infocomm Media Development Authority.\nFront row: (From left) Ms Jeanne Liew, Principal & CEO, Nanyang Polytechnic; Mr Soh Wai Wah,\nPresident & CEO, Singapore Polytechnic; Mr Peter Lam, President & CEO, Temasek Polytechnic;\nProf John Thong, Deputy President (Academic) & Provost, SIT; Mr Gerard Koh, Vice President,\nPeople & Culture, National Computer Systems; Mr Sam Liew, President, Singapore Computer\nSociety; and Mr Charlton Ong, Vice President, People & Culture, Group Enterprise &\nSingapore, Singtel.\n19\nENGIE and SIT Announce\nPartnership to Advance District\nCooling Across Southeast Asia\nSymbiotic collaboration will enable applied research, authentic learning\nspaces for SIT students, co-development of curriculum content, and\nknowledge sharing sessions for industry and community\nENGIE, a global leader in low\ncarbon energy and services, and the\nSingapore Institute of Technology\n(SIT),  Singapore’s first university\nof applied learning, have inked a\nMemorandum of Understanding\n(MoU) to jointly develop a district\ncooling centre of excellence in\nSingapore.\nThe ENGIE-SIT District Cooling\nCentre of Excellence will catalyse\ninnovation in cooling solutions\nacross APAC.

The intent was to give\nstudents the opportunity to go on\noverseas student exchanges to get\nworldly perspectives through an\neducation grant. Assistant Professor\nFrank Guan from SIT’s Infocomm\nTechnology (ICT) cluster\nand Assistant Professor Cheryl\nLian from the Health and Social\nSciences (HSS) cluster saw the\npotential in research collaboration\nand pursued the partnership.\nTitled the “DOSIS (Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-based solutions in\ndose management) project”, the\ncross-university partnership focused\non reviewing research on the\napplications of artificial intelligence\n(AI) to dose management in medical\nradiation imaging and radiation treatment. This multidisciplinary\napplied research project was\nfunded by the Finnish Education\nMinistry and involved SIT’s\nacademic staff and a group of 10\nSIT undergraduates.\nIntensive Virtual\nInteractions\nAdopting a co-creative teaching\nand learning pedagogic process,\na team of 17 ICT and radiography\nstudents from both universities\nworked together under the tutelage\nof five faculty members.\nCo-creative learning is a pedagogic\napproach engaging students in\ntaking responsibility for their own\nand fellow students’ learning\nexperience. This strategy combines\nstudent, lecturer and area of\nexpertise to create the best learning\nenvironment for the student. The\nfaculty taught students academic\nwriting where they were exposed to\na range of peer-reviewed literature.\nThey reviewed information\npresented in the research and new\nknowledge streams were created in\nthe process.\nThe three-year collaboration,\nwhich started in 2019, yielded a\nprolific output including four peer-\nreviewed journal publications, two conference posters, as well as two\noral conference presentations at the\n2022 International World Congress\nof Medical Physics and Biomedical\nEngineering held at Sands Expo &\nConvention Centre, Singapore. The\nsuccess of the DOSIS project also led\nto the development of a pedagogical\nframework that was shared at the\nApplied Learning Conference hosted\nby SIT earlier this year.\nSurging Forward with\nMutual Benefits\nGiven the success of DOSIS, both\ninstitutions decided to bring their\npartnership to the next level by\nformalising relations through a five-\nyear Memorandum of Understanding\nsigned on 5 October 2022. This new\nchapter in the relationship promises\nmultiple benefits for faculty and\nstudents on both sides, broadly\ncovering the areas of educational\nexchange, student internships and\njoint research.\nWorking on a new applied research\nproject, students and faculty from\nboth universities will work with\nhealthcare and health technology\nfirms on small-scale R&D projects.\nSIT students can look forward to\nfurther collaborations on research\nprojects supervised by faculty\nmembers from the two universities.\nThe possible option of taking\ncredit-earning study modules\ntaught by Metropolia University\nlecturers is also being explored.\nAdditionally, Integrated Work Study\nProgramme (IWSP) opportunities with\nSingapore and Finnish companies\nspecialising in healthcare technology\nsolutions are in the pipeline. SIT\nstudents selected for Overseas\nIWSP will be attached to Finnish\nhealthcare and health technology\nfirms for up to 12 months.\n“This is like an improved version\nof the DOSIS project, with the\npartnership expanded to include\nindustry players such as healthcare\nand health technology firms.\nStudents could potentially work\ndirectly on industry projects in the\nform of literature study, trial testing\nor the development of a new\ntechnology,” said Asst Prof Guan.\nThis article first appeared in SIT’s\nDigital Newsroom.\n23\nFrom Lab to Rail: SMRT and SIT\nto Set Up Transport Living Lab\nto Solve Operational Issues\nAn extension of SMRT’s engineering capabilities and\nresources, the Transport Living Lab will also provide an\nauthentic learning environment for SIT students and\nacademic staff to co-create land transport solutions\nSMRT Corporation Ltd (SMRT) and\nthe Singapore Institute of Technology\n(SIT) have signed a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (MoU) to strengthen\ntheir research and development\ncollaboration for the advancement\nof Singapore’s transport industry\nthrough engineering and\ntechnological innovation.\nA highlight of the collaboration\nis the building of the SMRT-SIT\nTransport Living Lab (TLL), an\nextension of SMRT’s Engineering\ngroup’s capabilities and resources\ncommitted to providing solutions\nto the needs of the land transport\nindustry.
