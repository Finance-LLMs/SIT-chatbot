This includes 783 graduates from SIT-conferred programmes, 524 graduates from SIT-overseas university (OU) joint programmes\n[1]\n, and 882 graduates from degrees conferred by SIT OU partners\n[2]\n.\nSingapore’s First Locally Trained Allied Health Professionals to Meet Demands of Healthcare Sector\nThe\noccasion also marks the graduation of the first batches of Allied Health students from SIT’s Diagnostic Radiography, Occupational Therapy, Radiation Therapy and SIT-Trinity College Dublin Physiotherapy programmes – the first degrees of their kinds by an Autonomous University.\nIn\na preliminary employment survey conducted by SIT\n[3]\n,\n97% of the 211 graduates in these programmes were contributing to Singapore’s healthcare workforce as much needed frontline workers.\nDegree Programme\nNo. of Graduates\nSIT-conferred\nBachelor of Science in Diagnostic Radiography\n52\nBachelor of Science in Occupational Therapy\n53\nBachelor of Science in Radiation Therapy\n12\nSIT-Trinity College Dublin Joint Programme\nBachelor of Science in Physiotherapy\n94\nAll Allied Health students at SIT undergo curricula that were developed comprehensively in consultation with Singapore’s public and private healthcare institutions. The Diagnostic Radiography, Radiation Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy as well as Speech Therapy programmes are recognised by the Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC). Students are also required to fulfill a 30- to 40-week Clinical Practice Education during their course of studies, where they are placed in a variety of clinical settings to hone their clinical skills.\nThe demand for Allied Health professionals in Singapore continues to rise to cater to the nation’s ageing population. At the same time, there has been a growing awareness and interest amongst today’s youths in the Allied Health professions.\nPioneer Batch of Graduates with Deep Technical Expertise in Civil Engineering\nThe university is also graduating its first cohort of students from the SIT-University of Glasgow\nCivil Engineering degree programme\n, which has strong relevance to the Built Environment and Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM), one of the 23 ITMs identified by the Future Economy Council (FEC). Launched in 2016, the programme aims to address the need for local manpower with the necessary civil engineering professional qualifications, in the face of sustained building and infrastructure developments.\nThe pioneer batch of 48 Civil Engineering graduates has been equipped with the practical knowledge and skills to plan, design, construct, maintain and operate infrastructure such as roads, rail, buildings and underground structures, as well as to rehabilitate ageing critical infrastructure in service. Graduates have also gone through an eight-month work attachment as part of SIT’s signature\nIntegrated Work Study Programme (IWSP), where they get to work on authentic hands-on tasks and projects together with their employers.\nSIT Graduates Highly Employable Amid Challenging Economic Climate\nBased on SIT’s\npreliminary employment survey\n[4]\n,\n91%\nof the respondents from the university’s Class of 2020\nhave secured employment since the completion of their studies.\nGraduates from the Information and Communications Technology (Software Engineering), Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering (Land) and Marine Engineering programmes obtained a 100% employment rate\n.\nProfessor Tan Thiam Soon, President, SIT, believes that this is a result of SIT’s industry-focused curriculum, as well as the success of its IWSP, which is mandatory for all students of\nSIT-conferred and SIT-OU joint programmes\n.\n“\nWe are thankful to have received strong support from our industry partners, allowing SIT to maintain high relevance of its programmes through continual consultation, adoption of best practices, applied research projects and IWSP.\nWith the duration of IWSP lasting between eight to 12 months with well-defined learning outcomes, students are assigned projects with a longer timeframe, and thus are able to learn more from this attachment and also make more significant contributions to the company.\nUpon graduation, our students can hit the ground running because of the solid foundation they received during their IWSP stint,” commented Prof Tan.\nSupport Measures for Class of 2020\nIn line with the university’s commitment to encourage lifelong learning, SIT has been offering its alumni, including the Class of 2020, $2,000 worth of\nSITizens Learning Credits\nsince 2019. The Credits can be used to apply for Continuing Education and Training modules offered by SITLEARN Professional Development, the lifelong learning division of SIT. These modules will allow graduates to pick up new skill sets to complement the competencies that they have acquired in their undergraduate years, and some of these modules can be stacked into Postgraduate Certificates.\nMade possible through the generosity of various donors, the\nStudent Relief Fund at SIT (COVID-19)\nhas been established to assist students, including the Class of 2020, who are facing financial hardship due to the pandemic. Eligible students may receive up to $2,000 each to help them with their daily living and education expenses\n. More than $2.2 million has been donated towards the Fund, benefitting 690 SIT students thus far.\nTo provide more employment opportunities for its graduates, SIT is also participating in the\nSGUnited Traineeship (SGUT)\nprogramme as a host company, with 17 divisions within the university offering traineeship positions for graduates.\nSIT graduates have also taken up SGUT opportunities in various other companies, including the university’s industry partners, and benefitted from their experience of working in the industry.\nVisit\nSIT Graduation Ceremony 2020/21\nfor the ceremonies' schedule, live streams and details\n.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nOU partners conferring joint degrees with SIT: DigiPen Institute of Technology, Massey University, Newcastle University, Trinity College Dublin and University of Glasgow.\n[2]\nOU partners conferring their own degrees: DigiPen Institute of Technology, Technical University of Munich, The Culinary Institute of America, The Glasgow School of Art, Trinity College Dublin, University of Glasgow and University of Liverpool.\n[3]\nData is accurate as of 31 December 2020, and obtained from graduates who responded to a preliminary employment survey conducted by SIT.\n[4]\nData is accurate as of 31 December 2020, and obtained from graduates who responded to preliminary employment survey conducted by SIT.\nThe Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is Singapore’s University of Applied Learning, offering applied degree programmes targeted at growth sectors of the economy.
