    "During CARDS, companies send teams of individuals to address early-stage challenges, including a complex balance of user desirability, business feasibility, and technical feasibility.",

These applicable solutions include, but are not limited to, business models, immersive spatial environments, and digital interfaces. Through multiple consultations with various experts, the innovation project team triangulates a set of solutions.",
    "This programme is cross-industry and applies if there is an interface between people and organisations.
