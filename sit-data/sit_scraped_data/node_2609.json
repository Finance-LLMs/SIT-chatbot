    "The Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Chemical Engineering jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University will be accepting its last cohort of students in AY2021.",
    "The cessation of this programme was determined as part of the regular review of our programme offerings. SIT and Newcastle University will ensure that the quality of teaching remains of a high standard until the last cohort of students graduates in 2024. This joint degree will continue to be recognised in Singapore and internationally.",
    "The Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Chemical Engineering is a three-year direct honours degree programme jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University.",
    "This programme aims to produce graduates who have a clear understanding of Chemical Engineering, combining a sound theoretical grasp of the subject with practical experience and an awareness of their responsibility to society and the environment. Consisting of key traditional Chemical Engineering topics such as Transfer Processes and Unit Operations, and including contemporary and globally important areas such as Sustainable Design and Clean Technology, students will learn how to critically analyse real-world process engineering problems through the use of computational tools.",
    "Assessment will be based on several components such as coursework and written examinations. Students will have the opportunity to creatively apply what they have learnt to solve challenges posed by their final year capstone plant design project. The academic training and soft skills acquired through the programme, will produce capable graduates who will go on to become professional chemical engineers in the industry. Graduates may also eventually choose to pursue industrial research to develop new solutions and innovative processes or a postgraduate route to an academic career.",
    "The Programme Educational Objectives",
    "The Programme Educational Objectives (PEOs) of this programme are closely aligned with the SITizen-DNA. Graduates of the Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Engineering Technology programmes, after working for five years, are expected to possess the following:",
    "Technical skills",
    "- Are equipped with the breadth and depth of technical knowledge, as well as the innovative, practical and analytical skills to solve complex engineering problems in the chemical and process industry.",
    "Attitude",
    "- Have responsible attitudes to solving problems and designing systems, as well as to applying professional and ethical judgements to balance risks, economics, reliability and societal needs to ensure safety, health and environmental sustainability.",
    "Leadership, team building",
    "- Are able to communicate and function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in multidisciplinary teams.",
    "Critical thinking",
    "- Are adaptable in a dynamic world and able to learn effectively for the purpose of continuing professional development and lifelong learning.",
    "Programme Highlights",
    "Practical Bias",
    "- Subjects are taught with a practical bias and the majority of modules have a substantive coursework component, complementing theory with practice.",
    "Problem-solving and the use of Computational Tools",
    "-",
    "Students will develop problem-solving skills and gain valuable experience through the use of commercial computational tools to solve chemical engineering problems.",
    "Gain Work Experience While Studying",
    "- Students will gain six to eight months of work experience under the Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) in the process engineering industry, with the unique opportunity to work on industry projects and solve problems.",
    "Remote video URL",
    "Integrated Work Study Programme",
    "Students will undergo a credited, 26-week full-time employment at an organisation relevant to their area of study. The Integrated Work Study Programme provides students with the opportunity to apply their engineering knowledge and practise professional skills learned through the programme, at the same time gaining valuable work and first-hand industry experience.",
    "Overseas Immersion Programme",
    "Students will undergo a three-week overseas immersion programme at the home campus in Newcastle, United Kingdom during which they will have the opportunity to participate in personal and career development workshops and other academic activities. The OIP also presents students with sufficient time to travel around the region, and participate in cultural and social events.",
