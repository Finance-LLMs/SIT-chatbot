    "Associate Professor Soh Chew Beng sharing with Yishun Innova Junior College students about the use of solar photovoltaic systems in SIT’s agrivoltaic farm, during their visit to SIT. (Photo: Soh Chew Beng)",
    "With climate change a mounting threat, scientists have called for urgent action before the world is pushed to the brink. Sustainability has become key to combating the impending climate disaster.",
    "At the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), students are prepared for a climate-disrupted world, armed with the skills to counter the effects. Through its education programmes, SIT supports Singapore’s commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and has embedded sustainability in the curriculum. Besides equipping students with deep technical knowledge and practical tools to create solutions in both the local and global contexts, SIT also involves them in implementing and finetuning the solutions via proof of concept or pilot projects.",
    "“With a global push towards sustainability, engineers need to embed good sustainability practices into the process and challenge themselves to create net-zero solutions,” said",
    "Associate Professor Kenneth Low",
    ", Cluster Director of Engineering at SIT.",
    "“Helping our next generation of engineers and graduates understand why it is important to embrace sustainability meaningfully is the first step.”",
    "Engineering Environmental Friendliness",
    "SIT students will have a first-hand green built environment experience at SIT’s new Punggol campus, due to be completed in 2024.",
    "Singapore has a sustainability roadmap to tackle this challenge. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 charts green targets over the next few years, which includes greening 80 per cent of buildings by 15 per cent. Buildings currently account for over 20 per cent of Singapore’s emissions.",
    "“It is important that the overall life cycle of buildings is taken into consideration, starting from adopting sustainable design principles, the use of sustainable construction materials and innovative technologies on energy harnessing and management,” said",
    "Associate Professor Soh Chew Beng",
    ", Programme Leader,",
    "Sustainable Built Environment",
    "(SBE) degree programme.",
    "The programme provides training in mechanical engineering and built environment design. Two electives, Integrated Facility Management and Green Building Design, integrate sustainability based on insights from the Industry Advisory Committee (IAC), a group of industry partners who are involved in the development of SIT’s curriculum and provides advice to ensure the curriculum is up to date.",
    "SBE also involves students in competitions like the Built Environment Case Competition (BECC), where they craft solutions for real-life sustainability issues.",
    "Teoh Mei Ting, a third year SBE student, said the programme has shaped her perspective about sustainability.",
    "“I’ve become more aware of the chain effect that sustainability can bring to the environment and society, as well as the potential source of momentum that can propel these efforts,” she said. Mei Ting also won the",
    "BECC 2021 competition",
    "with two other students, thanks to their concept of a futuristic, floating Singapore city to tackle climate change.",
    "With SIT’s new",

    "(NAME) degree programme prepares students for the industry. A three-week overseas immersion programme at Newcastle University is included, exposing them to the industry outside Singapore.",
    "As NAME focuses on digitalisation and decarbonisation, students will learn about designing eco-vessels, decarbonising ocean liners, using renewable energy sources and more.",
    "“NAME embeds maritime sustainability in various modules through a student's three-year learning journey. Some examples are electrification of marine vehicles, ship energy efficiency, energy-saving technologies, and offshore renewable energy,” said Associate Professor Wang Xin, Programme Leader, NAME.",

    "Assistant Professor Michael Kruesi teaching a class in Sustainable Hospitality Operation, a module under the Hospitality Business programme. (Photo: Michael Kruesi)",
    "Singapore’s sustainability journey extends to the hospitality industry as well. The Singapore Hotel Sustainability Roadmap, launched in March 2022, expects 60 per cent of hotel room stock to achieve internationally recognised sustainability certification",
    "by 2025 and to reach net zero emissions by 2050.",
    "SIT’s",
    "Hospitality Business",
    "(HB) degree programme, the only hospitality programme offered by an autonomous university in Singapore, trains students to adapt to any situation with real-world experience, inculcates speaking skills, and offers a support network and more.",
    "“I have been put through different tests, exposures and interactions,” said alumnus Edsel Li, who graduated in 2021. “The challenges at SIT forced me to adapt to different settings and not have a ‘one size fits all’ mindset.”",
    "Assistant Professor Michael Kruesi",
    ", who teaches the HB programme, said that a focus on sustainability helps businesses in the industry to stay ahead of the competition. “",
    "Sustainability practices have been proven to not only enhance revenue, but also offer a distinct competitive advantage and reduce operational costs in the hospitality industry.",
    "”",
    "As such, Asst Prof Kruesi’s sustainability module exemplifies important tools such as Green Balance, an application developed at SIT for hotel sustainability measurement and benchmarking, which is available for adoption nationwide. “This is one way that SIT has been able to make an impact on hotel sustainability in Singapore, and soon internationally,”",
    "he added.",
    "Students are also encouraged to integrate sustainable practices hands-on. At the",
    "Mapletree Challenge 2020",
    ", HB students proposed solutions to",
    "encourage recycling. One such innovation was a biodegradable toothpaste pod made of seaweed extracts.",

(Photo: Soh Chew Beng)\nWith climate change a mounting threat, scientists have called for urgent action before the world is pushed to the brink. Sustainability has become key to combating the impending climate disaster.\nAt the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), students are prepared for a climate-disrupted world, armed with the skills to counter the effects. Through its education programmes, SIT supports Singapore’s commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and has embedded sustainability in the curriculum. Besides equipping students with deep technical knowledge and practical tools to create solutions in both the local and global contexts, SIT also involves them in implementing and finetuning the solutions via proof of concept or pilot projects.\n“With a global push towards sustainability, engineers need to embed good sustainability practices into the process and challenge themselves to create net-zero solutions,” said\nAssociate Professor Kenneth Low\n, Cluster Director of Engineering at SIT.\n“Helping our next generation of engineers and graduates understand why it is important to embrace sustainability meaningfully is the first step.”\nEngineering Environmental Friendliness\nSIT students will have a first-hand green built environment experience at SIT’s new Punggol campus, due to be completed in 2024.\nSingapore has a sustainability roadmap to tackle this challenge. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 charts green targets over the next few years, which includes greening 80 per cent of buildings by 15 per cent. Buildings currently account for over 20 per cent of Singapore’s emissions.\n“It is important that the overall life cycle of buildings is taken into consideration, starting from adopting sustainable design principles, the use of sustainable construction materials and innovative technologies on energy harnessing and management,” said\nAssociate Professor Soh Chew Beng\n, Programme Leader,\nSustainable Built Environment\n(SBE) degree programme.\nThe programme provides training in mechanical engineering and built environment design. Two electives, Integrated Facility Management and Green Building Design, integrate sustainability based on insights from the Industry Advisory Committee (IAC), a group of industry partners who are involved in the development of SIT’s curriculum and provides advice to ensure the curriculum is up to date.\nSBE also involves students in competitions like the Built Environment Case Competition (BECC), where they craft solutions for real-life sustainability issues.\nTeoh Mei Ting, a third year SBE student, said the programme has shaped her perspective about sustainability.\n“I’ve become more aware of the chain effect that sustainability can bring to the environment and society, as well as the potential source of momentum that can propel these efforts,” she said. Mei Ting also won the\nBECC 2021 competition\nwith two other students, thanks to their concept of a futuristic, floating Singapore city to tackle climate change.\nWith SIT’s new\nPunggol campus\n, students will have a first-hand green built environment experience. The campus will incorporate green technologies like the low-carbon District Cooling System and Multi-Energy Microgrid.\nSetting Sail for Sustainability\nThe Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering programme\nfaculty members visit Penguin Tenaga, Singapore’s First Hybrid-Powered Vessel (Photo: Mark Teo)\nIn the maritime industry,\nglobal shipping activity accounts for 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 greenhouse gas study.\n[1]\nTechnological upgrades not only enhance maritime efficiency and safety, but can also cut emissions. As the world’s leading maritime capital, Singapore is poised to make a big impact on this front.\nJointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University, the\nNaval Architecture and Marine Engineering\n(NAME) degree programme prepares students for the industry. A three-week overseas immersion programme at Newcastle University is included, exposing them to the industry outside Singapore.\nAs NAME focuses on digitalisation and decarbonisation, students will learn about designing eco-vessels, decarbonising ocean liners, using renewable energy sources and more.\n“NAME embeds maritime sustainability in various modules through a student's three-year learning journey. Some examples are electrification of marine vehicles, ship energy efficiency, energy-saving technologies, and offshore renewable energy,” said Associate Professor Wang Xin, Programme Leader, NAME.\nIAC member Cristina Saenz de Santa Maria welcomes\nmaritime innovation. “The world is really going through a major global transformation, with the challenge we have with climate change,” she said. “We are really set for a maritime renaissance.”\nMore Sustainable Practices in Hospitality\nAssistant Professor Michael Kruesi teaching a class in Sustainable Hospitality Operation, a module under the Hospitality Business programme. (Photo: Michael Kruesi)\nSingapore’s sustainability journey extends to the hospitality industry as well. The Singapore Hotel Sustainability Roadmap, launched in March 2022, expects 60 per cent of hotel room stock to achieve internationally recognised sustainability certification\nby 2025 and to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\nSIT’s\nHospitality Business\n(HB) degree programme, the only hospitality programme offered by an autonomous university in Singapore, trains students to adapt to any situation with real-world experience, inculcates speaking skills, and offers a support network and more.\n“I have been put through different tests, exposures and interactions,” said alumnus Edsel Li, who graduated in 2021. “The challenges at SIT forced me to adapt to different settings and not have a ‘one size fits all’ mindset.”\nAssistant Professor Michael Kruesi\n, who teaches the HB programme, said that a focus on sustainability helps businesses in the industry to stay ahead of the competition. “\nSustainability practices have been proven to not only enhance revenue, but also offer a distinct competitive advantage and reduce operational costs in the hospitality industry.\n”\nAs such, Asst Prof Kruesi’s sustainability module exemplifies important tools such as Green Balance, an application developed at SIT for hotel sustainability measurement and benchmarking, which is available for adoption nationwide. “This is one way that SIT has been able to make an impact on hotel sustainability in Singapore, and soon internationally,”\nhe added.\nStudents are also encouraged to integrate sustainable practices hands-on. At the\nMapletree Challenge 2020\n, HB students proposed solutions to\nencourage recycling. One such innovation was a biodegradable toothpaste pod made of seaweed extracts.\nAs the world braces for climate change’s dire consequences, SIT students are prepared to do their part to ensure a sustainable future for all.\nAdmissions to SIT\nis open from now till 19 March 2023.\n[1]\nGHG emissions from international shipping. https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/environment/pages/ghg-emissions.aspx\nTopics\nFeatures\nHospitality Business\nSustainability\nPunggol\nMarine\nSITizens\nFuture Campus\nCATEGORIES\nAcademic Clusters\nEngineering\nSITizens & Campus\nBusiness, Communication and Design\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nOvercoming the Barrier to Learning\nview\nNext\nUpwards and Onwards – Fulfilling the Aviation Dream\nview\nRelated News\n26 Mar 2025\nPower Through Emotion\nSIT, Chemistry and Pod of Life unveil a new approach to combat workplace burnout through The Emotional Baggage Board Game.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Academic Clusters, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n18 Sep 2024\nOCBC to Invest $500 Million in Punggol Digital District\nInvestment includes a multi-million-dollar strategic partnership with SIT\ntag\nPress Releases, Industry & Community, Academic Clusters, Business, Communication and Design, Infocomm Technology\n23 Jun 2023\nHelping Mental Health Patients Lead Meaningful Lives\nCognitive remediation expert A/Prof Tan Bhing Leet was recently awarded the 2023 Connie Lieber Science to Practice Award for Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry.\ntag\nAcademic Clusters, Health and Social Sciences"
