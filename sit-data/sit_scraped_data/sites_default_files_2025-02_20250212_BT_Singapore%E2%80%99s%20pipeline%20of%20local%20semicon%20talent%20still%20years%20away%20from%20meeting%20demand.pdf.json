  "content": "SINGAPORE’S pipeline of local\nsemiconductor talent is still years\nbehind industry demand, even\nthough efforts to build it up are un-\nderway , said industry observers.\nIn the meantime, semicon firms\nmust rely on foreign manpower to\nmake up the shortfall – especially\nfor roles requiring specific techni-\ncal skills and expertise, such as in\nintegrated circuit design and man-\nufacturing process optimisation.\nT o address this, the Ministry of\nManpower (MOM) recently gave\ncompanies more flexibility to hire\nforeign talent for certain roles.\nIn November , three new semi-\ncon engineering roles were added\nto the shortage occupation list for\nEmployment Pass (EP) applicants:\nsemiconductor , instrumentation\nand process engineers.\nApplicants for jobs on this list\nget bonus points under the current\nEP framework, making it easier for\nthem to qualify .\nLocal workforce buildup\nThe addition of these semicon\nroles will help companies address\nimmediate manpower needs while\nthey wait for sufficient local talent\nto be developed, said industry\nplayers.\nIn response to The Business\nT imes’ queries, an Economic Devel-\nopment Board (EDB) spokesperson\nnoted that in the last two years, Sin-\ngapore secured more than S$ 1 8 bil-\nlion worth of semiconductor -relat-\ned investments in manufacturing,\nas well as research and develop-\nment.\n“These investments are generat-\ning demand for talent in areas such\nas integrated circuit design and mi-\ncrochip engineering, which require\nskill sets that will take time to build\nup,” said the spokesperson.\n“Occupations on the shortage\noccupation list will help the indus-\ntry meet these immediate skills\ngaps, to support the growth of the\nsemiconductor industry and the\nlocal supplier ecosystem that in-\ncludes precision engineering\nSMEs.”\nSingapore Institute of T echnolo-\ngy (SIT) associate professor andelectrical and electronic engineer-\ning programme leader Neelakan-\ntam V enkatarayalu noted rising in-\nterest from students in semicon-\nductor -related courses.\nFrom 2022 to 2024, SIT’s under-\ngraduate intake for engineering\ncourses grew1 8.9 per cent to1 ,0 1 5.\nCourses relevant to the semicon-\nductor industry have a “healthy”\nsubscription rate of three students\nfor each course vacancy , he added.\nWhile the admission process is\n“holistic”, the high subscription\nrate does mean that higher -per-\nforming students tend to be of-\nfered these courses.\nFresh graduates still need to be\ntrained when they enter the work-\nforce, he added.\nCompanies need to transfer\nspecialised knowledge of “their\nown products, manufacturing and\nprocesses capability”.\nGiven all this, it may take three\nto five years for Singapore to see a\n“more noticeable increase” in the\nlocal semicon talent pool, said Ang\nW ee Seng, Singapore Semiconduc-\ntor Industry Association (SSIA) ex-\necutive director .\n“Building a strong local semi-\nconductor talent pipeline takes\ntime as students need to be\ntrained, gain industry exposure\nand develop the necessary exper-\ntise before they enter the work-\nforce in full capacity ,” he said.\nAMD Singapore Chai Chee site\nlead El Saravanan estimated that it\ncould take about seven to eight\nyears for an engineering student to\ngain enough knowledge and profi-\nciency to take on in-demand job\nroles.\nSince various training initia-\ntives – including AMD’s own pro-\ngrammes – were rolled out only in\nthe past few years, it will take time\nfor them to bear fruit, he added.\nThe recent addition of semicon\nroles to the shortage occupation\nlist comes as multinational chip gi-\nants make new investment com-\nmitments in Singapore.\nThese include V anguard inter-\nnational Semiconductor Corpora-\ntion, NXP Semiconductor , Siltron-\nics and Micron, all of which have\nannounced and opened new plants\nin Singapore – with associated job\ncreation – since March 2024.\nFor instance, Micron’s new ad-\nvanced packaging facility at W oo-dlands is expected to create 1 ,400\njobs, on top of the company’s cur-\nrent Singapore headcount of over\n9,000.\nForeign employees whose roles\nare on the shortage occupation list\nmay enjoy greater certainty , as this\nmakes it easier for them to renew\ntheir EPs, said AMD’s Saravanan.\n“It gets difficult for them to...\nkeep their families with them... so\nthat is a push factor for some of the\nbrightest minds to leave this coun-\ntry ,” he said.\nGreater certainty may allow\nthem to bring their families to Sin-\ngapore, keeping them more rooted\nhere.\nLess impact on local firms\nHowever , the shortage occupation\nlist additions are not expected to\nhave a significant impact on local\nsemicon companies.\nLocal firms have adapted to em-\nploying fewer foreign workers as\nquotas have tightened over the\nyears, said Grand V enture T echnol-\nogy (GVT) chief executive Julian\nNg.\nGVT is looking to hire local engi-\nneers with mechatronics experi-\nence to introduce new products.Foreign workers are considered\nonly if they can offer specialised\nskill sets.\nThat EDB was the supporting\nsector agency for the additional\nshortage roles suggests that the\nmove aimed to support multina-\ntional corporations rather than lo-\ncal businesses, noted Ng. T ypical-\nly , local small and medium enter-\nprises would seek help from Enter-\nprise Singapore.\nAn MOM spokesperson told BT\nthat the shortage occupation list is\ndeveloped by MOM and the Minis-\ntry of T rade and Industry (MTI) in\nconsultation with sector agencies\nsuch as EDB, as well as tripartite\npartners.\nOccupations for the list are eval-\nuated based on three criteria: stra-\ntegic importance to Singapore’s ec-\nonomic priorities; the degree and\nnature of labour shortage; and the\nsector’s commitment to develop-\ning the local pipeline.\n“The SOL (shortage occupation\nlist) is a dynamic list that is regular-\nly reviewed by MOM and MTI to en-\nsure it remains responsive to\nchanges in the labour market,” said\nthe spokesperson.\nMeanwhile, both companiesand institutes of higher learning\n(IHLs) continue to invest in pro-\ngrammes to attract and train more\ntalent for the sector .\nThe EDB spokesperson said that\nthe agency and Enterprise Singa-\npore continue to work closely with\nsemiconductor companies and\nIHLs to equip Singaporeans with\nskill sets to participate in the sec-\ntor’s growth.\nMany options for learning\nSince 2022, AMD has partnered\nSSIA to hold an integrated circuit\ndesign camp for undergraduates,\ngiving them the chance to learn\nfrom practising engineers and ob-\ntain work experience.\nAlso since 2022, the College of\nDesign and Engineering at the Na-\ntional University of Singapore\n(NUS) has allowed students to spe-\ncialise in advanced electronics.\nThe course covers industry prac-\ntices related to semiconductor fab-\nrication, chip manufacturing, IC\ndesign and prototyping.\n“Students have also shown in-\ncreasing interest in pursuing semi-\nconductor -related courses and\nspecialisations, such as advanced\nelectronics,” said an NUS spokes-person. NUS graduate pro-\ngrammes also offer internship op-\nportunities at companies and re-\nsearch institutes such as Global-\nFoundries, Stats ChipPac and\nA*Star’s Institute of Microelectron-\nics.\nNanyang T echnological Univer-\nsity offers programmes that equip\ngraduates for roles such as IC de-\nsigners, failure analysts and proc-\ness engineers, and provides stu-\ndents with internship opportuni-\nties in the sector .\nBut associate provost for under-\ngraduate education Gan Chee Lip\nnoted that interest in semiconduc-\ntor -related specialisations has fluc-\ntuated over the years, due to per-\nceived challenging work condi-\ntions and cyclical trends in the in-\ndustry .\nT raining must also go hand in\nhand with talent retention, noted\nAMD’s Saravanan. That is why the\ncompany puts existing engineers\nthrough upskilling programmes in\ncollaboration with EDB and local\nuniversities.\n“T o get past MOM’s relief that\nthey have given us, we have to fo-\ncus on building our local pipeline\nfor longer -term needs,” he said.The addition of\nthese semicon\nroles will help\ncompanies\naddress\nimmediate\nmanpower\nneeds while\nthey wait for\nsufficient local\ntalent to be\ndeveloped,\nsaid industry\nplayers.\nPHOTO: BT FILE\nSingapore’s pipeline of local semicon talent still years\naway from meeting demand: industry watchers\nRecent flexibility to hire foreigners for certain roles will help firms close near-term gaps\nBy Yong Jun Yuan\nand Tessa Oh\njunyuany@sph.com.sg\ntessaoh@sph.com.sgThis document is intended for internal research purposes only.\nCopyright remains the property of the content creator.\nPublication: The Business Times\nDate: 12 Feb 2025\nHeadline: Singapore’s pipeline of local semicon talent still years away from\nmeeting demand: industry watchers\nSource: The Business Times © SPH Media Limited.
