    "Elevating Food Industry Standards Through Transnational Partnerships",
    "FoodPlant seeks a new frontier with strategic partnerships in the APAC region to accelerate commercial outcomes in food innovation and manufacturing.",
    "Technological transformation is happening at breakneck speed for businesses in all realms, and the food industry is no exception.",
    "As Singapore works to enhance its food security, local food manufacturers often grapple with these questions: Are there better ways to extend product shelf life? How can foods be made tastier and nutritionally optimal? Also, how do companies serve customers in new markets bearing lower risk?",
    "This is where Singapore’s first shared facility for small-batch food production,",
    "FoodPlant’s",
    "inclusion into the Asia Pacific Food Innovation Network (APacFIN), adds value.",
    "In February 2024, FoodPlant signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to form this network with three leading food innovation facilities in the region –",
    "The FoodBowl",
    "of New Zealand,",
    "South East Asia Food and Agriculture Science and Technology Center",
    "(SEAFAST) of Indonesia, and",
    "Sustainable Innovative Food Technologies (SIFT) Centre",
    "of Australia.",
    "FoodPlant’s CEO, A/Prof Lim Bee Gim (3rd from right), signed an MOU with FoodBowl, SEAFAST and SIFT — leading food innovation facilities in New Zealand, Indonesia and Australia, respectively. (Photo: FoodPlant)",
    "Under the MOU, these organisations will share knowledge, best practices, and research and development opportunities, as well as drive the development of food technology, innovation and networking across APAC. Through these efforts, not only will FoodPlant and its partners achieve better capabilities, but they will also be able to help its clients, ranging from small start-ups to multi-national companies, adopt new food processing technologies and grow their businesses with greater ease.",
    "An Immersive Talent Exchange",
    "FoodPlant’s Research Engineer,",
    "Ong Wai Peng",
    ", experienced firsthand the benefits of the APacFIN through a month-long talent exchange programme. From February to March this year, the 28-year-old worked at The FoodBowl’s sprawling facilities in Auckland.",
    "Wai Peng (right) worked alongside FoodBowl staff Mark on the Ultra High Temperature treatment machine for a production batch run. (Photo: The FoodBowl)",
    "“It was an eye-opening experience. The FoodBowl is 10 years older than FoodPlant and my stint there has sparked some ideas on how FoodPlant could evolve in the future,” shared Wai Peng.",
    "Wai Peng supports FoodPlant clients in product development, conducts training for Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) undergraduates and adult learners, and procures new equipment for the FoodPlant facility.",
    "Just like he would in Singapore, Wai Peng went into the depths of operations at The FoodBowl, attending business meetings, running through food production with clients and learning the ‘ins and outs’ of manufacturing practices and food safety standards in New Zealand.",
    "There are differences in culture and foundations of the food industry in both countries. After all, New Zealand is a major exporter of food products—the exact opposite of Singapore. However, there are parallels to be drawn, Wai Peng observed.",
    "“For instance, we both depend on other countries for packaging supplies. Also, we are similarly experiencing a huge amount of interest in plant-based foods from consumers.”As part of the exchange, Wai Peng was excited to get hands-on with processes like ultra-high temperature processing and ice-cream manufacturing.",
    "The daily team catch-ups at The FoodBowl also inspired Wai Peng to increase the frequency of short technical meetings in FoodPlant. “We can very swiftly update team members on matters such as equipment faults and share learnings from a completed project that can be immediately applied to one that’s just about to start, all of which contribute to efficient operations.”",
    "Wai Peng (right) gets hands-on experience with the ice-cream machine with guidance from FoodBowl staff, Mariana. (Photo: The FoodBowl)",
    "Building on Strengths",
    "While the immersive trip to New Zealand was chockfull of learnings for Wai Peng, he also left with appreciation of FoodPlant’s unique strengths.",
    "“Each of our project executives is the main touchpoint for our clients from start to finish. This makes it very easy and quick for us to address their needs. We are able to conduct food safety audits based on Singapore Food Agency’s regulations, rather than having to outsource the function.”",
    "Partnering with international counterparts like The FoodBowl brings about mutual benefits. For instance, FoodPlant can now help clients in Singapore tap into new innovative technologies that are not yet available locally. “We refer them to our partners for product development and even expand overseas with the partners’ know-how.”",
    "“At the end of the day, the network serves to uplift the whole industry so that knowledge doesn’t get lost in transition. To provide food security in Singapore especially, we must know how to process our food better and safely to provide high-quality foods for the country,” said Wai Peng.",
    "Advancing Knowledge Together",
    "“By collaborating with our partners, we harness each other's expertise in sustainable food technology, cutting-edge research, and best practices in food production. This mutual exchange of knowledge and resources allows us to collectively address industry challenges, foster innovation, enhance food security, and promote environmentally sustainable practices that benefit the entire food ecosystem,” said FoodPlant CEO, Associate Professor",
    "Lim Bee Gim",
    ", who also helms an international advisor role with partnering organisation, the SIFT Project Management Group.",
    "As an international advisor, A/Prof Lim would contribute to areas such as the Food Technology facility’s strategic direction, operating and funding models.",
    "Adding that the appointment is a recognition of FoodPlant’s accomplishments to date, A/Prof Lim stressed that leveraging the collective knowledge to tackle issues together would help drive significant advancements in the food industry, benefiting consumers, communities, and the environment.",

How can foods be made tastier and nutritionally optimal? Also, how do companies serve customers in new markets bearing lower risk?\nThis is where Singapore’s first shared facility for small-batch food production,\nFoodPlant’s\ninclusion into the Asia Pacific Food Innovation Network (APacFIN), adds value.\nIn February 2024, FoodPlant signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to form this network with three leading food innovation facilities in the region –\nThe FoodBowl\nof New Zealand,\nSouth East Asia Food and Agriculture Science and Technology Center\n(SEAFAST) of Indonesia, and\nSustainable Innovative Food Technologies (SIFT) Centre\nof Australia.\nFoodPlant’s CEO, A/Prof Lim Bee Gim (3rd from right), signed an MOU with FoodBowl, SEAFAST and SIFT — leading food innovation facilities in New Zealand, Indonesia and Australia, respectively. (Photo: FoodPlant)\nUnder the MOU, these organisations will share knowledge, best practices, and research and development opportunities, as well as drive the development of food technology, innovation and networking across APAC. Through these efforts, not only will FoodPlant and its partners achieve better capabilities, but they will also be able to help its clients, ranging from small start-ups to multi-national companies, adopt new food processing technologies and grow their businesses with greater ease.\nAn Immersive Talent Exchange\nFoodPlant’s Research Engineer,\nOng Wai Peng\n, experienced firsthand the benefits of the APacFIN through a month-long talent exchange programme. From February to March this year, the 28-year-old worked at The FoodBowl’s sprawling facilities in Auckland.\nWai Peng (right) worked alongside FoodBowl staff Mark on the Ultra High Temperature treatment machine for a production batch run. (Photo: The FoodBowl)\n“It was an eye-opening experience. The FoodBowl is 10 years older than FoodPlant and my stint there has sparked some ideas on how FoodPlant could evolve in the future,” shared Wai Peng.\nWai Peng supports FoodPlant clients in product development, conducts training for Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) undergraduates and adult learners, and procures new equipment for the FoodPlant facility.\nJust like he would in Singapore, Wai Peng went into the depths of operations at The FoodBowl, attending business meetings, running through food production with clients and learning the ‘ins and outs’ of manufacturing practices and food safety standards in New Zealand.\nThere are differences in culture and foundations of the food industry in both countries. After all, New Zealand is a major exporter of food products—the exact opposite of Singapore. However, there are parallels to be drawn, Wai Peng observed.\n“For instance, we both depend on other countries for packaging supplies. Also, we are similarly experiencing a huge amount of interest in plant-based foods from consumers.”As part of the exchange, Wai Peng was excited to get hands-on with processes like ultra-high temperature processing and ice-cream manufacturing.\nThe daily team catch-ups at The FoodBowl also inspired Wai Peng to increase the frequency of short technical meetings in FoodPlant. “We can very swiftly update team members on matters such as equipment faults and share learnings from a completed project that can be immediately applied to one that’s just about to start, all of which contribute to efficient operations.”\nWai Peng (right) gets hands-on experience with the ice-cream machine with guidance from FoodBowl staff, Mariana. (Photo: The FoodBowl)\nBuilding on Strengths\nWhile the immersive trip to New Zealand was chockfull of learnings for Wai Peng, he also left with appreciation of FoodPlant’s unique strengths.\n“Each of our project executives is the main touchpoint for our clients from start to finish. This makes it very easy and quick for us to address their needs. We are able to conduct food safety audits based on Singapore Food Agency’s regulations, rather than having to outsource the function.”\nPartnering with international counterparts like The FoodBowl brings about mutual benefits. For instance, FoodPlant can now help clients in Singapore tap into new innovative technologies that are not yet available locally. “We refer them to our partners for product development and even expand overseas with the partners’ know-how.”\n“At the end of the day, the network serves to uplift the whole industry so that knowledge doesn’t get lost in transition. To provide food security in Singapore especially, we must know how to process our food better and safely to provide high-quality foods for the country,” said Wai Peng.\nAdvancing Knowledge Together\n“By collaborating with our partners, we harness each other's expertise in sustainable food technology, cutting-edge research, and best practices in food production. This mutual exchange of knowledge and resources allows us to collectively address industry challenges, foster innovation, enhance food security, and promote environmentally sustainable practices that benefit the entire food ecosystem,” said FoodPlant CEO, Associate Professor\nLim Bee Gim\n, who also helms an international advisor role with partnering organisation, the SIFT Project Management Group.\nAs an international advisor, A/Prof Lim would contribute to areas such as the Food Technology facility’s strategic direction, operating and funding models.\nAdding that the appointment is a recognition of FoodPlant’s accomplishments to date, A/Prof Lim stressed that leveraging the collective knowledge to tackle issues together would help drive significant advancements in the food industry, benefiting consumers, communities, and the environment.\nTopics\nFoodPlant\nInnovation\nIndustry Immersions\nIndustry\nFood Technology\nCATEGORIES\nApplied Research & Innovation\nIndustry & Community\nFood, Chemical and Biotechnology\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nInnovation in Food Sustainability: SIT Students Shine at 22nd IUFoST World Congress\nview\nNext\nSIT Community Challenge 2024: Innovating Accessible Public Transport\nview\nRelated News\n14 May 2025\nEmpowering Stroke Survivors through Sport: SIT and SNSA-Led Campaign Earns Global Praise\nEmpowering fitness professionals to support stroke survivors for an inclusive fitness community.\ntag\nApplied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences\n09 May 2025\nLiving Medicine: How Engineered Bacteria Evolved from Combating Amebiasis to Revolutionising Cancer Treatment\nThe groundbreaking concept of engineered bacteria, initially developed to combat the parasitic infection amebiasis, has evolved into a revolutionary approach for treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma -by delivering cancer-fighting drugs with pinpoint accuracy\ntag\nApplied Research & Innovation\n06 May 2025\nFacilitating Post-Stroke Care With Gamified Intervention\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute of Technology co-designed a holistic mobile app with stroke survivors, caregivers and clinicians that delivers information on stroke through games and educational content.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Health and Social Sciences"
