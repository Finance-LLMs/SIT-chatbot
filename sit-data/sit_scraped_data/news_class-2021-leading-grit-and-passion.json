    "Class of 2021: Leading with Grit and Passion",
    "SIT celebrated the graduation of the Class of 2021 in October. Meet two graduates who have excelled in both their studies and leadership roles.",
    "Angel Joseph Sena, Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Chemical Engineering, Class of 2021",
    "Angel Joseph Sena",
    "Sporty and outgoing, Angel Joseph Sena thought she would follow in her father’s footsteps by pursuing a career in the military. But several brushes with engineering during her programme study changed her mind. “My work attachments with Sembcorp and Air Liquide Singapore when I was in SIT solidified my passion for engineering,” said Angel, a graduate from the Chemical Engineering programme jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University.",
    "At SIT, Angel pushed herself to take on many leadership roles even while juggling her studies. Spearheading events gave her the opportunity to contribute towards shaping SIT’s identity. She was a SITizen Ambassador and Vanguard – part of a group of experienced student leaders who inspire and guide other student leaders. Angel was also President of the Chemical Engineering Student Management Committee and Chairperson for “Dialogue with SITizens”. These efforts earned her the SIT Student Leaders Award. Angel also did well academically and was a recipient of the Choo Chiau Beng Overseas Immersion Programme Scholarship.",
    "Angel (centre) chaired the organising committee for ‘Dialogue with SITizens 2019’, with guest speaker Minister Chan Chun Sing (right).",
    "Countless Hours of Hard Work",
    "She recalled the struggles and concessions she had to make to achieve these goals. “I am not a fast learner, so I put many hours into studying and often stayed up until the wee hours of the morning for meetings and research,” said Angel. “For other activities, I would sometimes step back and give other students the chance to lead. That allowed me to learn from others whilst giving myself time to focus on my academic studies.” She also credits her parents, friends, and SIT faculty and staff for helping her throughout her journey.",
    "During Angel",
    "’",
    "s trimester break in year one, she worked at Sembcorp Industries Pte Ltd commissioning and decommissioning pilot water membrane plants. Her Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) at Air Liquide Singapore Pte Ltd saw her create innovative solutions in their hydrogen production plant.",
    "Putting her event organising skills to good use, Angel also moderated a ChemEx event that attracted a record number of participating companies. “It was an enriching experience because it made me step out of my comfort zone, to learn about the entire hydrogen plant and an air separation cryogenic plant. There were some hands-on tasks where I had to resolve the issues quickly and build structures to rectify them,” she added.",
    "Angel now works as a process engineer for HP Singapore Ink Manufacturing Operations at its Tuas site, where she oversees the ink-making process. She aims to practice innovative thinking and encourage collaboration among her colleagues. “I also want to pause and listen to my colleagues, so that I can gain more insights,” she said.",
    "Angela Goh, Bachelor of Food Technology with Honours, Class of 2021",
    "From left: Food Technology graduate Angela Goh. Angela with the SIT Women’s Tchoukball team.",
    "A research engineer and project executive at FoodPlant Pte Ltd, Angela Goh is working with her favourite subject matter: food. “Food exploration has always been my passion throughout my growing up years. Good food gives me extra dopamine when I’m happy and comforts me when I’m sad,” she said.",
    "It was a local infotainment series about how food goes from farm to table, which she watched when she was in her teens, that kindled her desire to learn the science behind food. That interest eventually led her to read the Food Technology programme jointly offered by SIT and Massey University.",
    "Angela’s passion for food is mirrored in her dedication to both her studies and sports. She was awarded the SIT Scholarship to pursue the Food Technology programme, and graduated with Honours with highest distinction. Her IWSP stint at FrieslandCampina led to a collaboration with the company for her Final-Year Project on the “Characterisation of Factors Influencing Non-Enzymatic Gelation in UHT Milk”. She had the privilege to present the project to Minister Lawrence Wong during his visit to SIT in October 2020. Angela was also awarded The Foo Family Outstanding Student Award for Excellence in Problem Solving component of IWSP in Food Technology.",
    "Angela (in the foreground) presenting her Final-Year Project to Minister Lawrence Wong.",
    "A Leader Who Inspires Others",
    "As Captain (2020",
    "–",
    "2021) and Vice-Captain (2019) of the Women’s Tchoukball team, Angela led her teammates to top placings in competitions, including Champions of SUniG 2018; 1st Runners-Up at the 9",
    "th",
    "Inter Tertiary Tchoukball Championships 2020; and 2nd Runners-Up at the 5",
    "th",
    "Asia-Pacific University Tchoukball Championship 2019 in Taiwan.",
    "“Leading the Tchoukball team was a challenge, especially during the pandemic when physical training sessions were suspended – I had to keep the team intact and connected for",
    "esprit de corps",
    ",” she said. The team’s efforts was rewarded with the SIT Meritorious Team Award 2019 and the SIT Inspire Award 2019, which recognises athletes who have displayed exceptional qualities in their ability to influence others and achieve positive outcomes.",
    "Now at FoodPlant, a small-batch food production shared facility jointly established by SIT, Enterprise Singapore, and JTC, Angela “aspires to inspire until she expires”. At her workplace, she participates in the setting-up and operation of the facility. Angela also provides technical support in the design, procurement, and commissioning of production lines as well as executes various other operations.",
    "“The food industry is a huge cauldron with many specialty fields,” she said. “Research suits me best. I hope to expand my knowledge in food processing and innovate food products that are safe, nutritious, tasty, and sustainable.”",

Meet two graduates who have excelled in both their studies and leadership roles.\nAngel Joseph Sena, Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Chemical Engineering, Class of 2021\nAngel Joseph Sena\nSporty and outgoing, Angel Joseph Sena thought she would follow in her father’s footsteps by pursuing a career in the military. But several brushes with engineering during her programme study changed her mind. “My work attachments with Sembcorp and Air Liquide Singapore when I was in SIT solidified my passion for engineering,” said Angel, a graduate from the Chemical Engineering programme jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University.\nAt SIT, Angel pushed herself to take on many leadership roles even while juggling her studies. Spearheading events gave her the opportunity to contribute towards shaping SIT’s identity. She was a SITizen Ambassador and Vanguard – part of a group of experienced student leaders who inspire and guide other student leaders. Angel was also President of the Chemical Engineering Student Management Committee and Chairperson for “Dialogue with SITizens”. These efforts earned her the SIT Student Leaders Award. Angel also did well academically and was a recipient of the Choo Chiau Beng Overseas Immersion Programme Scholarship.\nAngel (centre) chaired the organising committee for ‘Dialogue with SITizens 2019’, with guest speaker Minister Chan Chun Sing (right).\nCountless Hours of Hard Work\nShe recalled the struggles and concessions she had to make to achieve these goals. “I am not a fast learner, so I put many hours into studying and often stayed up until the wee hours of the morning for meetings and research,” said Angel. “For other activities, I would sometimes step back and give other students the chance to lead. That allowed me to learn from others whilst giving myself time to focus on my academic studies.” She also credits her parents, friends, and SIT faculty and staff for helping her throughout her journey.\nDuring Angel\n’\ns trimester break in year one, she worked at Sembcorp Industries Pte Ltd commissioning and decommissioning pilot water membrane plants. Her Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) at Air Liquide Singapore Pte Ltd saw her create innovative solutions in their hydrogen production plant.\nPutting her event organising skills to good use, Angel also moderated a ChemEx event that attracted a record number of participating companies. “It was an enriching experience because it made me step out of my comfort zone, to learn about the entire hydrogen plant and an air separation cryogenic plant. There were some hands-on tasks where I had to resolve the issues quickly and build structures to rectify them,” she added.\nAngel now works as a process engineer for HP Singapore Ink Manufacturing Operations at its Tuas site, where she oversees the ink-making process. She aims to practice innovative thinking and encourage collaboration among her colleagues. “I also want to pause and listen to my colleagues, so that I can gain more insights,” she said.\nAngela Goh, Bachelor of Food Technology with Honours, Class of 2021\nFrom left: Food Technology graduate Angela Goh. Angela with the SIT Women’s Tchoukball team.\nA research engineer and project executive at FoodPlant Pte Ltd, Angela Goh is working with her favourite subject matter: food. “Food exploration has always been my passion throughout my growing up years. Good food gives me extra dopamine when I’m happy and comforts me when I’m sad,” she said.\nIt was a local infotainment series about how food goes from farm to table, which she watched when she was in her teens, that kindled her desire to learn the science behind food. That interest eventually led her to read the Food Technology programme jointly offered by SIT and Massey University.\nAngela’s passion for food is mirrored in her dedication to both her studies and sports. She was awarded the SIT Scholarship to pursue the Food Technology programme, and graduated with Honours with highest distinction. Her IWSP stint at FrieslandCampina led to a collaboration with the company for her Final-Year Project on the “Characterisation of Factors Influencing Non-Enzymatic Gelation in UHT Milk”. She had the privilege to present the project to Minister Lawrence Wong during his visit to SIT in October 2020. Angela was also awarded The Foo Family Outstanding Student Award for Excellence in Problem Solving component of IWSP in Food Technology.\nAngela (in the foreground) presenting her Final-Year Project to Minister Lawrence Wong.\nA Leader Who Inspires Others\nAs Captain (2020\n–\n2021) and Vice-Captain (2019) of the Women’s Tchoukball team, Angela led her teammates to top placings in competitions, including Champions of SUniG 2018; 1st Runners-Up at the 9\nth\nInter Tertiary Tchoukball Championships 2020; and 2nd Runners-Up at the 5\nth\nAsia-Pacific University Tchoukball Championship 2019 in Taiwan.\n“Leading the Tchoukball team was a challenge, especially during the pandemic when physical training sessions were suspended – I had to keep the team intact and connected for\nesprit de corps\n,” she said. The team’s efforts was rewarded with the SIT Meritorious Team Award 2019 and the SIT Inspire Award 2019, which recognises athletes who have displayed exceptional qualities in their ability to influence others and achieve positive outcomes.\nNow at FoodPlant, a small-batch food production shared facility jointly established by SIT, Enterprise Singapore, and JTC, Angela “aspires to inspire until she expires”. At her workplace, she participates in the setting-up and operation of the facility. Angela also provides technical support in the design, procurement, and commissioning of production lines as well as executes various other operations.\n“The food industry is a huge cauldron with many specialty fields,” she said. “Research suits me best. I hope to expand my knowledge in food processing and innovate food products that are safe, nutritious, tasty, and sustainable.”\nTopics\nFeatures\nAlumni\nChemical Engineering\nFood Technology\nFoodPlant\nGraduation\nCATEGORIES\nAcademic Clusters\nFood, Chemical and Biotechnology\nSITizens & Campus\nMOST POPULAR\nSIT Graduate Journeys: The Code, the Cloud, and the Cargo\nSIT Launches Mangrove Conservatory with S$680,000 Support from the Foundation of Rotary Clubs Singapore\nMapletree Empowers Aspiring Innovators with Fifth Year of Support for The Mapletree Challenge\nSIT Launches First-of-its-kind Centre for AI  in Collaboration with NVIDIA\nMentors help SIT Interns ‘Mind-the-Gap’ at SMRT\nPrevious\nClass of 2021: Getting Hired Before Graduating\nview\nNext\nClass of 2021: From EM3 Student to Top University Graduate\nview\nRelated News\n26 Mar 2025\nPower Through Emotion\nSIT, Chemistry and Pod of Life unveil a new approach to combat workplace burnout through The Emotional Baggage Board Game.\ntag\nEducation, Applied Research & Innovation, Academic Clusters, Engineering, Business, Communication and Design, Food, Chemical and Biotechnology, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology\n18 Sep 2024\nOCBC to Invest $500 Million in Punggol Digital District\nInvestment includes a multi-million-dollar strategic partnership with SIT\ntag\nPress Releases, Industry & Community, Academic Clusters, Business, Communication and Design, Infocomm Technology\n23 Jun 2023\nHelping Mental Health Patients Lead Meaningful Lives\nCognitive remediation expert A/Prof Tan Bhing Leet was recently awarded the 2023 Connie Lieber Science to Practice Award for Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry.\ntag\nAcademic Clusters, Health and Social Sciences"
