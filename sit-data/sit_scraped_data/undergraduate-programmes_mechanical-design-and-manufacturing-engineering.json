    "The Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Engineering (MDME) is a three-year direct honours degree programme jointly offered by SIT and Newcastle University.",
    "Through a unique, interdisciplinary curriculum that combines essential knowledge from mechanical design, mechatronics and manufacturing, the programme is designed to meet the manpower needs of local engineering and manufacturing industries. Students will learn fundamental principles in mechanical engineering including statics, dynamics, materials, solid and fluid mechanics, control, thermodynamics, and heat transfer. Following these fundamentals, they will then be exposed to a curriculum that promotes process improvement and innovation which include topics on manufacturing technology, industrial automation, lean manufacturing, statistical process control, and smart production management. Students will learn to work independently, as well as in groups to collaboratively meet and exceed engineering project objectives.",
    "Within the duration of the course, students will undertake the Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) at engineering and manufacturing companies, to apply the knowledge gained from the course and to accumulate valuable work experience while networking with industry stalwarts. Students shall focus their work on engineering design and productivity improvement initiatives which may be carried through to their studies as Capstone Projects in the penultimate year of the programme. MDME graduates will be practice-oriented and work-ready to develop solutions for the engineering sector, as well as to enhance processes in the manufacturing industry.",
    "Programme Highlights",
    "A Robust and Industry-relevant Curriculum",
    "- Students will be taught a curriculum that synergises fundamental mechanical engineering knowledge with recent technological advancements in the fields of mechatronics and manufacturing. They will be equipped with the pre-requisite knowledge that encourages critical thinking and analytical skills which can prepare them for the engineering profession and also facilitate their progression to the chartered engineer status. Graduates are expected to meet the growing manpower demands and expertise requirements of local industries in the areas of design, digitalisation, industrial automation and productivity enhancements for the manufacturing sector.",
    "Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP)",
    "- Students will undertake their IWSP in the engineering and manufacturing industries which will provide applied learning opportunities to gain product design and operations management experiences.",
    "Integrated Work Study Programme",
    "Students will undergo an eight-month Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) at a company relevant to their areas of study. The IWSP provides an excellent opportunity to integrate what they have learnt in the classroom to what is practised in the industry. The extended work period also allows companies to evaluate the suitability of students to be potential future employees. Besides producing practice-oriented graduates, this work attachment stint can serve as a platform for initiating innovative industrial projects under the guidance of SIT academic supervisors and company-appointed work supervisors.",
    "Overseas Immersion Programme",
    "Students will have to undergo an attachment at the home campus of Newcastle University where they will experience life as a student in Newcastle, United Kingdom. The programme itinerary can include academic lectures, laboratory activities, library talks and literature review workshops to prepare students for their project work, as well as visits to engineering companies and key cultural landmarks.",
    "Combined Academic Staff for Teaching (CAST)",
    "Remote video URL",
    "The Combined Academic Staffing for Teaching (CAST) is an approach that gives you access to globally renowned academics from Newcastle University's UK campus, with the ease of them being locally accessible. Part of an innovative teaching model implemented in our SIT-NU joint programmes, these specialists bring a wealth of experience from various sectors, including industry, government, policy, and innovation, that will enrich your learning experience. Throughout your studies, you will have valuable opportunities to directly interact with these academics through our blended learning approach, which combines face-to-face and online classes.",
