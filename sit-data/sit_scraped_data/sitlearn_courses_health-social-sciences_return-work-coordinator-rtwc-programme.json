    "A systematic review of 14 studies showed that return-to-work coordinators (RTWCs) can improve return-to-work (RTW) rates and reduce intervention costs for ill or injured workers (Dol. et al., 2021).",
    "In Singapore, there has been an increasing awareness of the importance of the roles of RTWCs since the national RTW programme was launched in November 2017.",
    "This 2.5-day course has trained more than 80 healthcare professionals across various sectors with the core competencies of RTWCs since its first run in 2016 by the TTSH Occupational Therapy Department. In 2023, SIT has partnered with Tan Tock Seng Hospital to organise this workshop and extend it to non-healthcare professionals involved in facilitating RTW of ill/injured workers at their workplace.",
    "This course aims to equip participants with the core competencies of RTW coordinators to assess and facilitate the early RTW of ill or injured workers and collaborate with various stakeholders to develop an appropriate RTW plan. This will enable healthcare professionals and human resource/health and safety personnel to take on the roles of RTW coordinators working in hospital-based or workplace-based RTW programmes.",

    "Use a systematic approach to identify barriers and facilitators to RTW",
    "Describe the roles of different stakeholders in the RTW process",
    "Apply effective communication skills to collaborate with various stakeholders",
    "Develop an appropriate RTW plan to support early RTW",

She was the principal investigator in a Ministry of Manpower (MOM)-funded study on the effectiveness of hospital-based RTW coordinators in 2012 and had collaborated closely with Workplace Safety and Health Council on the “RTW coordination in Singapore- A guide for public hospitals” to support the roll out of the national RTW programme in 2017.
