    "Components of a Programme of Study",
    "A programme component may either be a module or a competency unit that a learner undertakes to fulfil the requirements of a programme of study. A programme component may also refer to a micro-credential, which is an 18-credit coherent block of learning and may be competency-based or non-competency-based. Competency-based micro-credentials comprise competency units, while non-competency-based micro-credentials comprise modules.",
    "A credit is a unit measure of a learner’s workload in each module or competency unit where one credit equates to 25 notional hours of contact time, projects, practical work, self-study, continual assessments (CA) and/or examination. For competency units, one credit can be associated with 6 to 8 hours of learning content. Learners undertaking competency units will need to accord additional practice time to demonstrate the required competencies through one or more assessments.",
    "Generally, each module is given a code that identifies it with the programme. The following figure shows an example of a Module Code, and the table below it provides descriptions of the digit representing the level of module.",

    "refers to the base of knowledge on which the subject matter of a particular module will be built. Before taking a module or competency unit, learners should complete any pre-requisite module(s) or competency unit(s) listed. A",
    "co-requisite",
    "is a requirement where modules or competency units may be taken at the same time or completed before the start of the specified module or competency unit.",
    "Preclusions",
    "are modules or competency units that have similar emphases and should not be taken together under the same programme.",
    "Learners who have queries concerning pre-requisites and/or co-requisites or wish to apply for a waiver from these requirements should consult their Programme Leaders and/or OU Degree Programme Directors before registering for the module or competency unit.",
    "Some programme components may be offered by SIT as credit-bearing standalone courses. These courses are suitable for learners who prefer an alternative learning pathway rather than enrolling in a full degree or graduate diploma programme at the onset of their studies. Credits obtained upon completion of such standalone courses may be recognised as fulfilling the requirements of a degree or a graduate diploma that a learner may later pursue, subject to certain conditions and the prevailing credit recognition policy. Learners interested in credit recognition may refer to the",

Learners who undertake competency-based micro-credentials may use this maximum workload of 30 credits per trimester as a guide when planning their academic progression in consultation with their Programme Leaders and/or OU Degree Programme Directors.

    "Learners who are unable to complete their programme requirements by the end of their maximum candidatures will have their candidatures terminated. Learners who require an extension beyond their maximum candidature can appeal for a candidature extension. Each appeal for a candidature extension will be considered on a case-by-case basis.",

A programme component may also refer to a micro-credential, which is an 18-credit coherent block of learning and may be competency-based or non-competency-based. Competency-based micro-credentials comprise competency units, while non-competency-based micro-credentials comprise modules.\nA credit is a unit measure of a learner’s workload in each module or competency unit where one credit equates to 25 notional hours of contact time, projects, practical work, self-study, continual assessments (CA) and/or examination. For competency units, one credit can be associated with 6 to 8 hours of learning content. Learners undertaking competency units will need to accord additional practice time to demonstrate the required competencies through one or more assessments.\nGenerally, each module is given a code that identifies it with the programme. The following figure shows an example of a Module Code, and the table below it provides descriptions of the digit representing the level of module.\nModule Level Codes\nDescription\nLevel 1\nIntroductory level core modules at undergraduate level.\nLevel 2\nIntermediate level core modules at undergraduate level.\nLevel 3/4\nDiscipline elective modules within a domain major, unrestricted elective module outside of a domain major or deep and specific discipline elective modules within a specialisation track of a major.\nLevel 6\nPostgraduate master’s level modules that cover advanced topics.\nLevel 8\nPostgraduate doctoral level modules that cover advanced topics.\nCompetency units are coded in the form “ABCWXYZ\nC\n”, where:\n“ABC” is a 3-letter prefix that denotes the academic cluster;\n“W” is a number indicating the competency level;\n“XYZ” is the competency unit number, with the first digit \"X\" denoting the programme/discipline; and\n“\nC\n” denotes that this is a competency-based module.\nThe table below provides descriptions of the digits representing the competency level.\nCompetency Level\nDescription\nLevel 1\nIntroductory level competency units.\nLevel 2\nIntermediate level competency units.\nLevel 3\nSpecific competencies within a specialisation track of a major.\nLevel 4\nDeep and specific competencies within a specialisation track of a major.\nLevel 6\nPostgraduate master’s level competency units which typically cover advanced topics in their respective domains.\nLevel 8\nPostgraduate doctoral level competency units which typically cover advanced topics in their respective domains. These competency units could be offered specially for doctoral candidates.\nCertain modules or competency units may have specific pre-requisites, co-requisites and preclusions criteria. A\npre-requisite\nrefers to the base of knowledge on which the subject matter of a particular module will be built. Before taking a module or competency unit, learners should complete any pre-requisite module(s) or competency unit(s) listed. A\nco-requisite\nis a requirement where modules or competency units may be taken at the same time or completed before the start of the specified module or competency unit.\nPreclusions\nare modules or competency units that have similar emphases and should not be taken together under the same programme.\nLearners who have queries concerning pre-requisites and/or co-requisites or wish to apply for a waiver from these requirements should consult their Programme Leaders and/or OU Degree Programme Directors before registering for the module or competency unit.\nSome programme components may be offered by SIT as credit-bearing standalone courses. These courses are suitable for learners who prefer an alternative learning pathway rather than enrolling in a full degree or graduate diploma programme at the onset of their studies. Credits obtained upon completion of such standalone courses may be recognised as fulfilling the requirements of a degree or a graduate diploma that a learner may later pursue, subject to certain conditions and the prevailing credit recognition policy. Learners interested in credit recognition may refer to the\nRecognition of Prior Learning section\nor contact their Programme Leaders for more information.\nchevron--up\nAcademic Workload\nThe academic workload of a learner per trimester is determined based on the total credits of programme components in which the learner is enrolled for that trimester of study.\nThe maximum academic workload per trimester allowed is 30 credits. Learners who undertake competency-based micro-credentials may use this maximum workload of 30 credits per trimester as a guide when planning their academic progression in consultation with their Programme Leaders and/or OU Degree Programme Directors. For other learners, special approval by their respective Programme Leaders and/or OU Degree Programme Directors would be required if they wish to read or repeat modules or competency units beyond the maximum workload in any trimester.\nchevron--up\nCandidature\nThe normal candidature of a degree programme or graduate diploma is the duration that learners are typically expected to take to complete that programme.\nA programme’s maximum candidature is the maximum duration that learners are allowed to take to complete that programme. The maximum candidature is set as six trimesters (two years) in addition to the normal candidature for degree and graduate diploma programmes.\nLearners who take longer than the normal candidature period for their enrolled programmes should note that there may be implications on the tuition fees charged. Further details are available in the\nAcademic Workload and Maximum Candidature page\nin the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required).\nLearners who are unable to complete their programme requirements by the end of their maximum candidatures will have their candidatures terminated. Learners who require an extension beyond their maximum candidature can appeal for a candidature extension. Each appeal for a candidature extension will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nAdditional trimesters taken by learners to repeat an assessment, re-attempt a competency and/or repeat a module/competency unit will also count towards the candidature period. The same will apply to make-up assessments.\nThe normal and maximum candidatures for different programmes, unless otherwise specified, are summarised in the table below.\nType of Programme\nCredits\nNormal Candidature (trimesters)\nMaximum Candidature (trimesters)\nUndergraduate\n180\n8\n14\n240\n11\n17\nMaster’s By Coursework\n60\n6\n12\nPostgraduate By Research – Master’s Degree\n18 (+ Research Component)\n6\n12\nPostgraduate By Research – Doctoral Degree\n36 (+ Research Component)\n12\n18\nGraduate Diploma\n48\n6\n12\nchevron--up\nRecognition of Prior Learning\nThis section is not applicable to learners enrolled in SIT-University of Glasgow Bachelor of Science with Honours in Nursing.\nLearners who have taken relevant modules within or outside of SIT’s degree programmes may seek credit recognition for those modules as partial fulfilment of the current programme’s requirements.\nCredit exemption may be granted for learners with recognised modules/courses completed before enrolment into the current programme. The application for credit exemption is opened\nonce\nfor all learners during matriculation.\nDuring their course of study at SIT, learners may apply for credit transfer. Learners taking industry certification-based modules and/or any other modules pre-approved for credit recognition by the respective Programme Leader and/or OU Degree Programme Director (e.g., modules taken while on a student exchange programme) should follow the instructions provided by their respective Academic Programme Administrator/Programme Leader and/or OU Degree Programme Director for the credit transfer application.\nReversal of exemption and/or credit transfer will\nnot\nbe permitted once the application is approved.\nCredit-bearing modules/courses with results\nawarded by SIT\nwill be recognised with full grade and credit transfer if the modules are mapped towards the graduation requirements of the current programme. The grades and credits of the recognised modules/courses will be included in the CGPA computation of the current programme and there is no cap on the number of SIT credits that may be recognised, unless otherwise specified.\nCredit-bearing modules/courses with results\nawarded by other institutions\nwill be recognised with credit transfer but without grade transfer if the modules/courses are mapped towards the graduation requirements of the current SIT programme. The grades and credits of the recognised modules/courses will\nnot\nbe included in the CGPA computation of the current programme, and there is a 50% cap on the credits that may be recognised.\nThe table below summarises the treatments for module/course credits awarded by SIT, or by other institutions if SIT approves the credit transfer application.\nCredit Awarding Authority\nGrade Transfer and count towards CGPA\nCap on Credits Recognised as Percentage of Current Programme’s Requirement\nCredits from modules with results awarded by SIT\nYes\nNo Cap (unless otherwise specified)\nCredits from modules with results awarded by other institutions\nNo\n50%\nCredits awarded within five years prior to enrolment into the current SIT programme will be considered for credit recognition to ensure currency of the subject matter within the programme. This 5-year limit is measured from the completion date of the module/course, or the programme in which the module/course is part of, whichever is the latest.  In addition, SIT will also adopt prevailing requirements imposed by the relevant accreditation bodies regarding the recognition period.\nNotwithstanding the paragraph above, credits earned more than five years prior to enrolment into the current programme may be considered on a case by-case basis. This will depend on factors such as evidence to support that the learner’s prior experience and learning remain relevant and current in the context of the nature of the subject matter and industry.\nFor non-competency-based programmes, the window period for learners to apply for transfer of credits will be published under the\nAnnouncements in the Student Intranet Homepage\n(SIT log-in credentials are required). Learners may submit their applications in IN4SIT during this window period. The\nIN4SIT Transfer of Credits Student User Guide\nis available in the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required).\nCertain modules, such as the SIT University-level modules (i.e., modules indicated as “University” type in respective programme’s Curriculum Structure) and Capstone project for undergraduate programmes are generally\nnot eligible\nfor credit exemption, unless there are exceptional circumstances approved by the learner’s Programme Leader.\nFor Programmes Delivered via the Competency-based Stackable Micro-credential Pathway\nLearners who plan to enrol into a programme delivered via the Competency-based Stackable Micro-credential pathway can seek recognition of prior learning for credit recognition at the following levels:\nMicro-credential\nCompetency unit within a micro-credential\nComponent of Workforce Essentials\nCredit recognition is granted only for verifiable learning. Credit recognition may also be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the content of study. The credit recognition will take into consideration the relevance of the module, number of hours undertaken by learner, learning outcomes, etc.\nIf a learner is unable to present verifiable evidence of their learning, the learner may be required to attempt an alternative test recommended by SIT.\nA learner may still be granted recognition of prior learning and subsequent credit recognition for competencies that cannot be directly mapped to the programme, if the competencies are assessed to be highly relevant to the learner’s degree by the Programme Leader.\nLearners are encouraged to consult their respective Programme Leader before applying or if they have any queries about the recognition of prior learning.\n.alpha-list {\n        list-style-type: none; \n        counter-reset: list-counter;\n      }\n\n      .alpha-list li {\n        counter-increment: list-counter;\n        margin-bottom: 5px;\n      }\n\n      .alpha-list li::before {\n        content: \"(\" counter(list-counter, lower-alpha) \") \";\n      }\nModule and Micro-credential Enrolment\nchevron--up\nModule Enrolment\nNewly matriculated learners and existing learners from selected programmes will be enrolled for modules before the start of the first trimester, or the next trimester of study, respectively.\nLearners who are required to register for the next trimester’s modules must do so during the designated window period, typically between Week 11 and Week 13 of each trimester. Information and updates on module enrolment are published on\nAnnouncements in the Student Intranet Homepage\n(SIT log-in credentials are required) and made available via emails from the Registrar’s Office or respective programme administrators. Learners are advised to check their emails and announcements in the Student Intranet for regular updates during the module enrolment period.\nLearners returning to studies from a Leave of Absence (LOA) are to approach their Academic Advisors/Mentors for guidance before proceeding with module enrolment.\nEnrolment for SIT modules will be done through the Course Management menu in IN4SIT. The\nIN4SIT Module Registration Guide\nis available in the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required).\nFurther information will be made available in the\nModule Registration section\nin the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required) and via emails from SIT Registrar’s Office or respective programme administrators.\nModule enrolment is on a first-come, first-served basis.\nCertain programmes and modules allow a Wait List option. Learners may opt to be placed on a Wait List for a module that has reached its maximum enrolment capacity. Learners should contact the Academic Programmes Administration (APA) Division (email to\nACDPRG@SingaporeTech.edu.sg\n) to check if the module(s) that they wish to enrol for has/have a Wait List option. There is no guarantee that vacancies will be created for learners in the waitlist as it depends on the availability of venues and additional resources to conduct extra classes.\nchevron--up\nEnrolment into Micro-credentials\nSpecific enrolment periods will be assigned to learners for the enrolment into the micro-credentials. This will happen before the start of the trimester.\nLearners will be informed on the enrolment periods through their SIT emails from the Academic Programmes Administration (APA) and/or their respective programme administrators. Once enrolled into a micro-credential, learners will be pre-enrolled into the micro-credential’s relevant competency units.\nLearners resuming their studies after LOA are strongly encouraged to approach their success coaches for guidance before enrolling into micro-credentials.\nchevron--up\nConsequences of Not Enrolling for Modules/Competency Units\nWith the exception of Postgraduate by Research programmes, all learners are required to be enrolled for at least one module or competency unit in any study trimester. Learners who are not enrolled for any modules or competency units during a study trimester are required to apply for LOA within 2 weeks from the start of the trimester to retain their SIT learner status.\nLOA taken will be counted towards the candidature period. Learners who fail to apply for LOA will be subject to administrative withdrawal.\nLearners who do not have any modules to enrol in a study trimester will be placed on a special break term, which will be counted towards the candidature period.\nFor a trimester which is an academic break in their programme, learners may choose to either take a break or enrol for modules outside of their programme offered during the break. Learners who choose to take up modules during the break will proceed with module enrolment following the normal process.\nchevron--up\nLearners’ Responsibility\nLearners are to take full responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the modules, micro-credentials and/or competency units enrolled during the stipulated enrolment window period. Learners are required to check their timetables to ensure that details are in order. Should there be any discrepancy, learners should report to Academic Programmes Administration (APA) (email to\nACDPRG@SingaporeTech.edu.sg\n) immediately before the window period closes.\nWhile striving to provide accurate and updated information, SIT reserves the right to amend the schedules and/or class venues, where applicable and necessary. Learners are expected to check their SIT emails regularly, as any updates will be made known to them via their SIT email accounts.\nSIT does not condone the following acts and will not hesitate to take the necessary disciplinary actions against such conduct:\nLearners who apply for modules or competency units they do not need and subsequently trade the allocation for personal gains.\nLearners who use unauthorised technology to gain an advantage over other learners in securing enrolment.\nLearners who do not follow the proper instructions and, regardless of their intentions, overload the enrolment system and cause major disruption to the enrolment exercise.\n.alpha-list {\n        list-style-type: none; \n        counter-reset: list-counter;\n      }\n\n      .alpha-list li {\n        counter-increment: list-counter;\n        margin-bottom: 5px;\n      }\n\n      .alpha-list li::before {\n        content: \"(\" counter(list-counter, lower-alpha) \") \";\n      }\nAssessments, Grading and Repeat Attempt\nchevron--up\nAssessment and Examinations\nLearners’ performance in a module or competency unit is measured through continual assessments, such as assignments, quizzes and/or tests, and in some cases, a final assessment which may take the form of an examination at the end of the trimester.\nAll final assessments and examinations (if any) will take place in Week 14 of each trimester, unless otherwise specified. In some instances, the final assessment/examination may be scheduled in Week 7.\nThe timetable for final assessments/examinations that are scheduled during the recess week (Week 7) will be posted in\nIN4SIT\n(SIT log-in credentials are required), or made available via email to learners, by Week 4. For those scheduled in the Final Assessment Week (Week 14), the timetable will be posted in\nIN4SIT\n(SIT log-in credentials are required) or made available via email by Week 9 of the trimester. If final assessments are scheduled outside of either Week 7 or Week 14, the programme administrator will inform learners accordingly. It is important for learners to note their own final assessments/examinations schedule as no concession will be made for learners who did not attend an assessment if they overlooked the schedule.\nLearners who are absent with valid reasons (e.g., submission of medical certificate or documentary proof) for their assessment/examination (including repeat assessment/examination, if relevant) will be allowed to take the make-up assessment/examination within the same trimester with approval from the respective Module Lead/Programme Leader/OU Degree Programme Director. Such learners who were unable to take the make-up assessment/examination within the same trimester will be allowed to take the make-up assessment/examination in the subsequent trimester as stipulated by the Module Lead/Programme Leader/OU Degree Programme Director. No administrative fee will be charged for make-up assessments/examinations.\nFurther details, including the examination rules and regulations and to seek for due consideration in assessment grading in case of an unforeseen situation such as an illness or personal or family issues during an assessment, can be found under\nExamination Matters\nin the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required).\nLearners are reminded that any act that compromises academic integrity is considered Academic Misconduct and will not be tolerated. Learners are therefore required to comply with\nSIT's Academic Integrity Policy\n, which can be found in the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required).\nInstances of academic misconduct may include, but are not limited to:\nCheating in and/or violation of rules governing an examination, test, assessment, project and/or quiz;,\nHaving in possession any unauthorised materials or devices during an examination, test, assessment and/or quiz;\nUsing unauthorised devices, gadgets, materials or technology to complete an assessment or project;\nPlagiarising the work of another person and presenting that “work” as one’s own (i.e. failing to give appropriate citation and/or acknowledgement; paraphrasing too close to the original source, including minor copying of material) and ghost-writing;\nColluding with other learners on an assessment which is meant to completed individually;\nImpersonating another learner with the intent of providing academic advantage or disadvantage to that learner;\nFabricating, falsifying or making up data, information, or citations;\nAny sabotaging act that prevents other learners from completing/submitting their work;\nGiving or receiving unauthorised assistance in academic work or assignments to or from other students; and\nProviding false claims to lecturers/staff concerning a submitted work and/or submission of work.\nFurther details and examples are provided in the\nAcademic Integrity Policy\n, which can be found in the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required).\nRegarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, learners are expected to seek clarification from their instructors on the appropriate ways to use such tools in their studies. Learners are cautioned against any misuse that may compromise academic integrity, particularly in the works submitted for grading purposes.\nLearners found guilty of committing an act of academic misconduct will be dealt with according to SIT’s Student Disciplinary Policy. The\nStudent Disciplinary Policy\nis available in the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required.).\n.alpha-list {\n        list-style-type: none; \n        counter-reset: list-counter;\n      }\n\n      .alpha-list li {\n        counter-increment: list-counter;\n        margin-bottom: 5px;\n      }\n\n      .alpha-list li::before {\n        content: \"(\" counter(list-counter, lower-alpha) \") \";\n      }\nchevron--up\nSIT Grading System\nSIT adopts a 5-point Grade Point Average (GPA) letter-grading system for modules and competency units.

Exceptions may apply to selected modules under SIT-Overseas University (OU) joint programmes due to specific requirements of the programme.\nAdditional information for learners of joint SIT-OU programmes\ncan be found in the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required).\nTo pass a competency unit, a minimum grade of C (grade point 2.00) is required.\nFor research programmes, the minimum module grade which Industrial Master’s (IM) learners must obtain is B- (grade point 3.00). For Industrial Doctorate (ID) programmes, a minimum module grade of B (grade point 3.50) is required.\nThe graduation requirement for each programme is specified under each programme-specific information section.\nGrade Point Average (GPA) represents the average grade of a group of letter-graded components attempted by a learner. Depending on the programme, a learner’s GPA may be computed based on the letter-graded components taken over a trimester (Trimester Grade Point Average), candidature (Cumulative Grade Point Average) or academic year (Year Grade Point Average).\nTrimester Grade Point Average (TGPA) represents the grade point average of all\nletter-graded\nprogramme components\nµ\nattempted by a learner in any trimester.

This may be done across two trimesters. If a learner has not demonstrated the required competencies in a competency unit within the first trimester and extends to the second trimester, the competency unit will be reflected with an “In Progress” (IP) grade for the first trimester. Learners who are unable to demonstrate the competency within the two trimesters will be awarded an “Incomplete” (IC) grade for the competency unit. The learner will have to repeat the affected competency unit in the trimester that the competency unit is next offered. More information regarding enrolment is available under the\nModule and Micro-credential Enrolment section\n.\nAfter the release of results, learners of\nundergraduate\nor\nspecialist certificate\nprogrammes who have obtained an F or IP grade for any module/competency unit which is part of the programme requirements will be required to repeat the assessment, depending on the requirements of the failed/\"in progress\" module/competency unit and the decision of the Programme Leaders and/or OU Degree Programme Director, unless otherwise specified. Exceptions apply to selected SIT-Overseas University programmes due to specific requirements of the programme.\nAdditional information for learners of these programmes\ncan be found in the Student Intranet (SIT log-in credentials are required).\nFor\npostgraduate programmes\n, learners who have obtained the following grades may apply for repeat assessment for the affected modules. The application will be subjected to the respective Programme Leader’s approval. Alternatively, such learners may choose to repeat the affected modules (further details in the Repeat Module and Re-Attempt of a Competency Unit sub-section below).\nPostgraduate Programmes\nModule Grade eligible for repeat assessment/repeat module\nMaster’s by Coursework, Postgraduate/Graduate Diploma and Postgraduate/Graduate Certificate\nC and below\nPostgraduate by Research – Master’s Degree\nC+ and below\nPostgraduate by Research – Doctoral Degree\nB- and below\nIf the learner fared poorly across multiple assessments, the learner may be asked to repeat the entire module/competency unit.\nAn administrative fee of $81.75 (inclusive of 9% GST) per module is applicable for repeat assessments.\nLearners who are unable to attain the minimum grade required to clear the module/competency unit and/or specific programme requirements following repeat assessment attempts will be required to repeat the module or re-attempt the competency unit on the Programme Leader’s discretion.\nMore information regarding enrolment is available under the\nModule and Micro-credential Enrolment section\n.\nThe grade point for a module/competency unit following a repeat assessment attempt administered after results release will be capped as specified under the\nSIT Grading System section\n.\nRepeat Module or Re-attempt of a Competency Unit\nLearners of undergraduate programmes who have obtained an F, D, D+ or IC grade for any module/competency unit programme requirements may choose to repeat/re-attempt the entire module/competency unit with approval from the respective Programme Leader and/or OU Degree Programme Director. If such module/competency unit is part of a micro-credential, the learner may register for the same micro-credential in the trimester it is next offered to repeat or re-attempt the affected module/competency unit. The grades and credits of the modules/competency units that learners had passed in that micro-credential will be carried over.\nFor the postgraduate programmes, learners who obtained the grades listed in the table in the Repeat Assessment sub-section may choose to repeat the affected modules with approval from their Programme Leaders.\nIn the case of repeating/re-attempting a module or competency unit, learners will be billed according to the prevailing credit charging.\nThe grade point for the repeat module/competency unit will be capped as specified under the\nSIT Grading System section\n.\nLeave of Absence and Withdrawal\nchevron--up\nLeave of Absence\nLearners who require a temporary break from their programmes can apply for Leave of Absence (LOA), subject to the maximum candidature of their programme. With effect from Academic Year 2024/25, all LOAs (including those due to personal or medical reasons) will count towards the learners’ candidature period in a programme. LOAs due to medical reasons applied before 2 September 2024 will not count towards the candidature period.\nLearners may apply for a maximum of three trimesters of absence in each LOA application. Applications\nmust\nbe made by the end of Week 2 of the affected trimester, otherwise tuition fees for the trimester will be charged. Applications received after Week 7 will only be processed after the release of results for that trimester.
