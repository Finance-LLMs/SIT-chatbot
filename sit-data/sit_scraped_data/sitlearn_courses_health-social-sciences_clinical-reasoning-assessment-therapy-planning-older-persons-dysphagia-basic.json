    "This workshop will equip speech-language therapists with knowledge and skills to apply clinical reasoning when assessing and planning therapy for persons with swallowing difficulties, especially for those of advanced age.",
    "Designed in two parts, learners may choose to attend this basic level workshop or extend their learning in the",
    "“Clinical Reasoning in Assessment and Therapy Planning for Older Persons with Dysphagia – Intermediate”",
    "workshop.",
    "Designed for speech-language therapists who already possess a foundational understanding of basic assessment techniques (e.g., oral motor examination, clinical bedside evaluation), this workshop will focus on enhancing clinical reasoning skills through paper-based case studies involving scenarios of older persons.",
    "Learners will explore the anatomy and physiology of swallowing, enhance their understanding of the age-related changes that affect swallowing, and be exposed to various assessment methods for dysphagia in the older person. This includes clinical observations, case history interviews, and instrumental assessments such as videofluoroscopy and endoscopy.",
    "Learners will examine common medical conditions and comorbidities prevalent among older adults such as dementia, delirium, neurological injuries, sepsis, and nutritional issues, and how these conditions impact swallowing and treatment planning.",
    "They will also learn about the different treatment approaches and interventions for managing dysphagia, including compensatory techniques, exercise-based therapies, dietary modifications, and adaptive equipment. Effective communication with dysphagic clients and their families will be emphasised. Learners will appreciate how to better counsel, educate, and support patients and caregivers who need strategies to improve swallowing and oral health.",
    "The workshop will also outline the ethical and professional considerations when working with older persons with dysphagia, and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration for optimising care for the older person with dysphagia. Ethical and legal considerations, including consent, advocacy, privacy, and confidentiality, will also be addressed to ensure learners are well-prepared for clinical practice.",

    "Discuss the role of performing comprehensive clinical observations of swallowing in older persons, including assessing posture, oral motor function, and signs of aspiration or penetration",
    "Identify the appropriateness of instrumental assessments, considerations for instrumental assessments and understand the physiological changes of dysphagia via instrumental assessments",
    "Develop individualised treatment plans for older persons with dysphagia, incorporating appropriate therapeutic techniques, compensatory strategies, and dietary modifications",
    "Discuss how to provide counselling and education to older persons with dysphagia and their families, offering guidance on safe swallowing techniques, dietary modifications, and strategies for maintaining optimal oral health",
    "Identify potential barriers and challenges in managing dysphagia in older persons (e.g., cognitive impairments, comorbidities, medication interactions, ethical considerations), and devise appropriate strategies to address them",
