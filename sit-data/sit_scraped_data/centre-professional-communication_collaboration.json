    "ALIGN Grant: Developing Critical Reflection Skills via Social Innovation",
    "Project Duration:",
    "1 September 2024 to December 2025",
    "PI:",
    "A/Prof Lee Chien Ching",
    "Co-PIs:",
    ": Intan Azura binte Mokhtar and Dan Chia Wei Ming",
    "Key Focus:",
    "This study aims to analyze students’ reflections in five design thinking phases for their social innovation project. The phases include: empathize and define (background research on social issues, identify a project focus and target beneficiary group, establish ethical procedures for data gathering from stakeholders, reframe the issue based on data gathered), ideate (define the value proposition for the stakeholders), create (develop the solution) and consolidate (test their solution) and review (the test findings with the stakeholders and the team). A transformative pedagogy was adopted to help students internalize what they were experiencing and learning as students wrote formative reflections leading to a summative solution.",
    "ALIGN Grant: Development and Evaluation of an Intelligent Application for the Communication Helpdesk & Library Research Consultation Service",
    "Project Duration:",
    "September 2022 to July 2023",
    "PI:",
    "Asst Prof Kenneth Ong",
    "Co-PIs:",
    "Asst Prof Radhika Jaidev, Asst Prof Nisha Jain, Asst Prof Padma Rao, A/Prof Vivek Balachandran, Mr Azlan Bin Ithnin, Ms Joan Wee Jee Foon, Ms Kimmy Xing Yidong",
    "Key Focus:",
    "Our project aims to develop and evaluate an intelligent application for the Communication Helpdesk and the SIT Library’s research consultation service. Currently, both services rely on a third-party web-based software, WCOnline, that have various constraints that limit learning efficacies of peer tutoring and librarian-student consultations. A prototype web-based application for the Communication Helpdesk was developed by a team of 4 ICT students that have the following features: fine-grained tutor-tutee matching, automatic and integrated feedback function for both tutors and tutees, Zoom API wrapper that retrieves Zoom meeting details and a chat function that tutors and tutees can use to communicate last-minute changes to tutoring sessions. However, in order to optimize the learning efficacies of both services, the prototype application needs to be expansively developed as a mobile and web-based application to become intelligent and personalized to every user, harnessing user data to predict and prescribe both tutoring sessions for the Communication Helpdesk as well as research consultation sessions for the SIT Library. We believe this proactive approach via the intelligent application would boost student take-up rates for the two services. The proposed app would also increase timeliness of feedback on students’ learning and boost learning gains in academic writing, self-regulation and motivation.",

    "Asst Prof Rosmawati",
    "Key Focus:",
    "This project focuses on exploring variability surrounding the developmental trajectories of students’ mastery and use of syntactic features of academic writing in English. Underpinned by the Complex Dynamic Systems Theory, this project applies tools and methods inspired by this theory to trace and explore the non-linear development pathways of syntactic complexity constructs in students’ writing to understand the underlying process of changes as manifested in those texts.",
    "Measuring Multifractality in English Text",
    "In collaboration with Prof Wander Lowie (University of Groningen)",
    "PI:",
    "Asst Prof Rosmawati",
    "Key Focus:",
    "This research project threads into an under-explored territory of fractal linguistics. While the concept of fractals is more known to those in the hard science fields, the very existence of fractals transcends disciplinary boundaries and is prevalent anywhere in nature - you can find them in the forest, in the river network, in snowflakes, in cauliflowers, and inside our own body (in our vein structure). Even in an abstract such as language, fractals exist. In the study of fractal linguistics, evidence has been put forward to demonstrate fractality in language - by proving that the distribution of linguistic constructs follows the power-law relationship. However, the nature of this fractal property of language has not been explored beyond this relationship. Furthermore, considering the way natural languages are used, it is highly likely that language is a multifractal structure (instead of a mono-fractal). This study sets out to test this hypothesis and explore the nature of multifractality in language. As an exploratory study, it focuses on English texts first before moving on to other languages.",
    "English Language and Communication Classes in Higher Education",
    "In collaboration with Prof Emeritus Marjolijn Verspoor (University of Groningen)",
    "PI:",
    "Asst Prof Rosmawati",
    "Key Focus:",
    "This book project is an upcoming edited volume that showcases English language/communication courses in tertiary education institutions around the world. Courses (or modules) on English language and communication skills are prevalent in many universities and institutes of higher learning around the world. In English as a medium of instructions (EMI) institutions particularly, these courses are frequently part of the curriculum for students regardless of their disciplines/major specialisations.",
    "An example is the ubiquitous first-year writing course that is now near mandatory in almost any tertiary institution across the globe. The approach taken in the implementation of these courses, however, varies from institution to institution and country to country. Therefore, there is a need to put together a volume that maps the landscape of these courses, focusing on curriculum design innovations, instructional strategies, classroom challenges, assessment practices in the teaching and learning process. The book identifies themes and pedagogies used, discusses challenges, and shares the team’s reflection on the teaching and learning practice in these courses.",

Ms Shirley Joseph, Senior Lecturer and Senior Academic Mentor at the Centre for Life Skills at Temasek Polytechnic, recently embarked on a four-month industrial attachment with CPC. A seasoned tertiary educator, Ms Joseph is passionate about sharing her experience in teaching and engaging students.

    "CAC Immersion for Lecturers from the School of Life Skills & Communication (LSC), Singapore Polytechnic (SP)",
    "Two CPC faculty members, Senior Lecturers Chris Bedwell and Nazarene Ibrahim, are working on a knowledge and expertise exchange project with lecturers from LSC, SP. The project aims to encourage both parties to learn and understand the communication challenges that students face before and during their time at university. The exchange of knowledge and skills expertise will be beneficial in course design, pedagogy and assessment in both spheres.",

    "Dr. Lee Chien Ching was the trainer of the IWSP Coaching and Mentoring Workshop (Day 2), organised by NACE@ SIT.",
    "Participants gained insights into how to craft learning outcomes and the principles of good assessment in workplace training and learning. They learned how to design simple rubrics to assess competencies, including technical and transferable skills, and how they can add value to the workplace as workplace trainers based on SIT’s applied learning model and the workplace learning framework.",
