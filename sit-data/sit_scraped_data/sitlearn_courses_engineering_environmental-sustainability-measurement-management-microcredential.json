    "As the world and Singapore increasingly prioritise sustainable development, the demand for environmental sustainability knowledge and skillsets within the workforce is rapidly growing.",
    "This micro-credential aims to equip learners with competencies to measure and manage environmental sustainability as solutions are implemented.",
    "Learners will explore the foundational sciences of environmental sustainability, recognising the pivotal role of the natural environment in sustaining the economic system. This understanding sets the stage for comprehending the necessity and rationale behind employing specific metrics. General frameworks and processes like carbon accounting and life cycle assessment, as well as sustainability reporting frameworks, standards, processes, and techniques will also be introduced.",
    "Additionally, learners will explore the tools and techniques for driving sustainable development, including sustainability business models, green financing, sustainability strategies (including climate change mitigation and adaptation), and sustainable development policy.",
    "Learners will then address project problems, which include defining and measuring sustainability states, and developing solutions to advance sustainability. Learners will pitch these solutions to demonstrate their understanding of applied sustainability measurement and management.",
