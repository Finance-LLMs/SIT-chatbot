    "Coaching Students in Higher Education: A Solution-Focused Approach to Retention, Performance and Wellbeing",
    "Routledge, 2024",
    "May Sok Mui Lim, Nadya Shaznay Patel, Ramesh Shahdadpuri",
    "This practical guide for educators in higher education encourages readers to ask effective coaching questions and apply relevant coaching techniques to empower and engage students to grow and perform at their best.",
    "Filled with authentic examples and handy tips, the book takes readers from the ‘how to’ of coaching, through the practicalities, challenges and honing of existing skills and new capabilities. The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.",
    "This is a resourceful text for educators, teachers and professionals working in higher education and learning institutions. It provides training material for institutions that want to conduct faculty development programmes to prepare educators for effective coaching conversations in their universities.",

    "Today, “all institutions of higher education almost everywhere in the world have been influenced by the concept of globalisation. The resulting policy changes in each nation-state have, of course, reflected the degree of the impact of globalisation on the country, hence the changes in higher education.” (Banya, 2005, p.147). This points to globalisation shaping knowledge production as well as the spread of intentional and continuous waves of innovation. The effects of globalisation on education can be seen through a) the changing paradigm from a closed system to a more open system, and b) the changing approach from a teacher-centred learning environment to that of a learner-centred environment. This changing approach culminates in the broader ideas of ‘applied learning’ through a) a productive view of learning versus the reproductive view of learning, b) constructivist versus behaviourist, c) learning facilitation versus teaching, and d) process-based assessment versus outcome-based assessment (Rudic, 2016).",

    "The adoption of learning analytics in blended learning environments: An exploratory study in Singapore",
    "14th International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge, 2024",
    "Xiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Ching Yee Pua, Shermain Puah, Oran Zane Devilly, Peng Cheng Wang, Eric Chern-Pin Chua",
    "In the aftermath of COVID-19, blended learning (BL) has emerged as the dominant mode of learning. With our university transitioning to a new campus where BL is expected to seamlessly integrate into its physical design, it is anticipated to become an indispensable component of the student experience. However, there appears to be a paucity of research into students’ perceptions of digital support and satisfaction with interactions within BLEs at higher education, especially in the post-COVID-19 era. In this paper, we utilize the learning analytics (LA) cycle as an overarching framework to shape our study’s methodology. Our aim was to examine students’ perceptions of digital relatedness support (DRS) and satisfaction with learner-technology interaction (SLTI) across three modules (n = 305) at our university. To achieve this objective, we conducted a cross-sectional survey complemented by focus group discussions (FGDs). Over 50% of respondents had positive perceptions of DRS and SLTI. In addition, statistically significant differences were observed between two pairs and one pair of modules for DRS and SLTI, respectively. The FGD data provided some possible reasons for the differences in DRS and SLTI scores across modules. This paper concludes with some recommendations to enhance DRS and SLTI.",

    "The effect of gamification mechanics on user experiences of AdventureLEARN: A self-driven learning platform",
    "ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 2023",
    "Chek Tien Tan, Oran Zane Devilly, Sok Mui Lim, Bavani Divo, Xiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Jamil Jasin, Ker Boon Seaw, Lin Aung Htei",
    "Both important components of tertiary education. Prior gamification research in tertiary education has mostly evaluated gamification as a system and largely in structured curriculum-based learning environments. There is insufficient understanding as to how different gamification mechanics affect learning experiences in self-driven personal development areas outside of the structured curriculum. We present a study with 20 tertiary students over seven days with AdventureLEARN, a gamified online platform to engage students in a self-driven journey of continuous personal development alongside their curriculum work. Through an analysis of data collected from experience sampling and focus group discussions, we found that, amongst other findings, gamification mechanics that were meticulously contextualized to specific platform features afforded the most positive experiences across various dimensions, leading to our main insight highlighting the importance of maintaining a co-development process between individual gamification mechanics and platform features.",

    "Students’ Approaches to Learning (SAL) and their relations to burnout among university freshmen in Singapore",
    "ELITE 2023 International Conference on Engaged Learning & Innovative Teaching in Higher Education, 2023",
    "Xiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Shermain Puah, Ching Yee Pua, Oran Zane Devilly, Sok Mui Lim",
    "This study investigates the reciprocal relationship between students’ approaches to learning (SAL) and burnout among year-one university students. Prior research has linked SAL (i.e., deep, unreflective, organised studying) to burnout (i.e., exhaustion, cynicism, inadequacy), but few studies have explored the bidirectional relationship between SAL and burnout. To bridge this research gap, data from two cohorts of freshmen (Cohort 1, n = 261; Cohort 2, n = 216) were collected via the SAL scale (SALS) and school burnout inventory (SBI) at the beginning",
    "and end of their first year. Both cohorts exhibited bidirectionality between unreflective approach (UA) and cynicism, indicating that increased UA could lead to higher cynicism, and vice-versa. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing the interplay between UA and cynicism for interventions targeting UA reduction and emphasizes the need to consider the potential unintended consequences of heightening freshmen’s cynical attiudes towards studying when attempting to reduce UA.",

    "User Engagement Scale Short Form (UES-SF): Adaptation and preliminary assessment of dimensionality in higher education students from a Singapore-based university",
    "HERDSA, 2023",
    "Xiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Peng Cheng Wang, Avnit Karin, Shukla Monika",
    "User engagement (UE) is the quality of user experience marked by an individual’s affective, behavioural, cognitive, and temporal devotion when interacting with a digital system. UE appears to be highly dependent on the type of digital environment and thus it is important to measure whether students are engaged effectively when using the digital tools. The UES-SF is one instrument that has been used in recent years to measure user engagement. However, there is a paucity of research on its use in the Asian higher education context as prior studies have documented its use with mostly Western adult populations (O’Brien et al., 2018).",
    "The initiative/practice. Our study has two objectives. First, we adapted the UES-SF to measure higher education students’ engagement with a series of online self-paced videos that we designed to engage students in learning Engineering mathematics and physics concepts. Second, we assessed the factor structure and reliability of the adapted UES-SF.",
    "Methods of evaluative data collection and analysis. A sample of 155 participants from various Engineering degree programmes at a Singapore-based university completed the UES-SF at one time point within an academic term. The psychometric properties of the UESSF were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).",
    "Evidence of outcomes and effectiveness. Results suggest that a four-factor solution was a mediocre fit to the data. Cronbach’s alpha for Focused Attention (FA), Perceived Usability (PU), Aesthetic Appeal (AE), and Reward (RW) were .54, .74, .84, and .88, respectively. These results suggest that the UES-SF could be a valid and reliable measure for user engagement with online self-paced videos. However, more research is needed with larger samples of university students across academic disciplines and institutions in the Asian context to verify the above findings.",

    "Mediating role of students’ approaches to learning in the relationship between grit and burnout amongst first-year university students in Singapore",
    "HERDSA, 2023",
    "Xiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Anna Parpala, Shermain Puah, Oran Zane Devilly, Sok Mui Lim",
    "Many first-year university students often lack the skills to identify appropriate learning strategies, and this may lead to increased burnout (Salmela-Aro et al., 2009). Although grit has been found to act as a protective factor against burnout, however, the effect of students’ approaches to learning (SAL) in explaining or mediating the relation between grit and burnout, is still unexamined among higher education students. Grit (broadly defined as the passion and perseverance in striving for long term goals; Duckworth, 2016), burnout, and SAL are important factors for succeeding in university education.",
    "The initiative/practice. This study examined if SAL acts as an intervening factor (mediator) between grit and burnout in a sample of 261 first-year students across various disciplines (e.g., Engineering, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology) at a Singapore-based university.",
    "Methods of evaluative data collection and analysis. Data was collected via self-report questionnaires at two-time points, beginning (grit and SAL) and end (burnout) of the first year. A mediation model employing Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was performed, with SAL as a mediator between grit and burnout.",
    "Evidence of outcomes and effectiveness. The results revealed that unreflective approach mediated the relation between passion (i.e., grit) and cynicism (i.e., burnout), implying that adopting lower unreflective approaches explained why more passionate first-year students experienced lower cynicism. To reduce burnout, it is therefore important for educators to find practical ways to instil the passion in learning (e.g., cultivating gritty classroom culture, cultivating traits related to grit), in addition to reducing the focus on unreflective approaches to learning (e.g., fostering ability to monitor learning, relating learning to prior knowledge). Our study advances the understanding of how grit, SAL, and burnout are related, and potentially aids professionals at higher education intervene in the learning processes of first-year students.",

    "The implementation of chatbot-mediated immediacy for synchronous communication in an online chemistry course",
    "Springer, 2023",
    "Jamil Jasin, He Tong Ng, Indriyati Atmosukarto, Prasad Iyer, Faiezin Osman, Peng Yu Kelly Wong, Wean Sin Cheow, Ching Yee Pua",
    "Low student engagement and motivation in online classes are well-known issues many universities face, especially with distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online environment makes it even harder for teachers to connect with their students through traditional verbal and nonverbal behaviours, further decreasing engagement. Yet, addressing such problems with 24/7 synchronous communication is overly demanding for faculty. This paper details an automated Question-Answering chatbot system trained in synchronous communication and instructor immediacy techniques to determine its suitability and effectiveness in attending to students undergoing an online Chemistry course. The chatbot is part of a new wave of affective focused chatbots that can benefit students’ learning process by connecting with them on a relatively more humanlike level. As part of the pilot study in the development of this chatbot, qualitative interviews and self-report data capturing student-chatbot interactions, experiences and opinions have been collected from 12 students in a Singaporean university. Thematic analysis was then employed to consolidate these findings. The results support the chatbot’s ability to display several communication immediacy techniques well, on top of responding to students at any time of the day. Having a private conversation with the chatbot also meant that the students could fully focus their attention and ask more questions to aid their learning. Improvements were suggested, in relation to the chatbot’s word detection and accuracy, accompanied by a framework to develop communication immediacy mechanics in future chatbots. Our findings support the potential of this chatbot, once modified, to be used in a similar online setting.",

    "In the aftermath of COVID-19, blended learning (BL) has emerged as the dominant mode of learning. With our university transitioning to a new campus where BL is expected to seamlessly integrate into its physical design, it is anticipated to become an indispensable component of the student experience. However, there appears to be a paucity of research into students’ perceptions of digital support and satisfaction with interactions within BLEs at higher education, especially in the post-COVID-19 era. In this paper, we utilize the learning analytics (LA) cycle as an overarching framework to shape our study’s methodology. Our aim was to examine students’ perceptions of digital relatedness support (DRS) and satisfaction with learner-technology interaction (SLTI) across three modules (n = 305) at our university. To achieve this objective, we conducted a cross-sectional survey complemented by focus group discussions (FGDs). Over 50% of respondents had positive perceptions of DRS and SLTI. In addition, statistically significant differences were observed between two pairs and one pair of modules for DRS and SLTI, respectively. The FGD data provided some possible reasons for the differences in DRS and SLTI scores across modules. This paper concludes with some recommendations to enhance DRS and SLTI.",
    "Both important components of tertiary education. Prior gamification research in tertiary education has mostly evaluated gamification as a system and largely in structured curriculum-based learning environments. There is insufficient understanding as to how different gamification mechanics affect learning experiences in self-driven personal development areas outside of the structured curriculum. We present a study with 20 tertiary students over seven days with AdventureLEARN, a gamified online platform to engage students in a self-driven journey of continuous personal development alongside their curriculum work. Through an analysis of data collected from experience sampling and focus group discussions, we found that, amongst other findings, gamification mechanics that were meticulously contextualized to specific platform features afforded the most positive experiences across various dimensions, leading to our main insight highlighting the importance of maintaining a co-development process between individual gamification mechanics and platform features.",
    "This study investigates the reciprocal relationship between students’ approaches to learning (SAL) and burnout among year-one university students. Prior research has linked SAL (i.e., deep, unreflective, organised studying) to burnout (i.e., exhaustion, cynicism, inadequacy), but few studies have explored the bidirectional relationship between SAL and burnout. To bridge this research gap, data from two cohorts of freshmen (Cohort 1, n = 261; Cohort 2, n = 216) were collected via the SAL scale (SALS) and school burnout inventory (SBI) at the beginning\nand end of their first year. Both cohorts exhibited bidirectionality between unreflective approach (UA) and cynicism, indicating that increased UA could lead to higher cynicism, and vice-versa. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing the interplay between UA and cynicism for interventions targeting UA reduction and emphasizes the need to consider the potential unintended consequences of heightening freshmen’s cynical attiudes towards studying when attempting to reduce UA.",
    "User engagement (UE) is the quality of user experience marked by an individual’s affective, behavioural, cognitive, and temporal devotion when interacting with a digital system. UE appears to be highly dependent on the type of digital environment and thus it is important to measure whether students are engaged effectively when using the digital tools. The UES-SF is one instrument that has been used in recent years to measure user engagement. However, there is a paucity of research on its use in the Asian higher education context as prior studies have documented its use with mostly Western adult populations (O’Brien et al., 2018).\nThe initiative/practice. Our study has two objectives. First, we adapted the UES-SF to measure higher education students’ engagement with a series of online self-paced videos that we designed to engage students in learning Engineering mathematics and physics concepts. Second, we assessed the factor structure and reliability of the adapted UES-SF.\nMethods of evaluative data collection and analysis. A sample of 155 participants from various Engineering degree programmes at a Singapore-based university completed the UES-SF at one time point within an academic term. The psychometric properties of the UESSF were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).\nEvidence of outcomes and effectiveness. Results suggest that a four-factor solution was a mediocre fit to the data. Cronbach’s alpha for Focused Attention (FA), Perceived Usability (PU), Aesthetic Appeal (AE), and Reward (RW) were .54, .74, .84, and .88, respectively. These results suggest that the UES-SF could be a valid and reliable measure for user engagement with online self-paced videos. However, more research is needed with larger samples of university students across academic disciplines and institutions in the Asian context to verify the above findings.",
    "Many first-year university students often lack the skills to identify appropriate learning strategies, and this may lead to increased burnout (Salmela-Aro et al., 2009). Although grit has been found to act as a protective factor against burnout, however, the effect of students’ approaches to learning (SAL) in explaining or mediating the relation between grit and burnout, is still unexamined among higher education students. Grit (broadly defined as the passion and perseverance in striving for long term goals; Duckworth, 2016), burnout, and SAL are important factors for succeeding in university education.\nThe initiative/practice. This study examined if SAL acts as an intervening factor (mediator) between grit and burnout in a sample of 261 first-year students across various disciplines (e.g., Engineering, Health and Social Sciences, Infocomm Technology) at a Singapore-based university.\nMethods of evaluative data collection and analysis. Data was collected via self-report questionnaires at two-time points, beginning (grit and SAL) and end (burnout) of the first year. A mediation model employing Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was performed, with SAL as a mediator between grit and burnout.\nEvidence of outcomes and effectiveness. The results revealed that unreflective approach mediated the relation between passion (i.e., grit) and cynicism (i.e., burnout), implying that adopting lower unreflective approaches explained why more passionate first-year students experienced lower cynicism. To reduce burnout, it is therefore important for educators to find practical ways to instil the passion in learning (e.g., cultivating gritty classroom culture, cultivating traits related to grit), in addition to reducing the focus on unreflective approaches to learning (e.g., fostering ability to monitor learning, relating learning to prior knowledge). Our study advances the understanding of how grit, SAL, and burnout are related, and potentially aids professionals at higher education intervene in the learning processes of first-year students.",
    "Low student engagement and motivation in online classes are well-known issues many universities face, especially with distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online environment makes it even harder for teachers to connect with their students through traditional verbal and nonverbal behaviours, further decreasing engagement. Yet, addressing such problems with 24/7 synchronous communication is overly demanding for faculty. This paper details an automated Question-Answering chatbot system trained in synchronous communication and instructor immediacy techniques to determine its suitability and effectiveness in attending to students undergoing an online Chemistry course. The chatbot is part of a new wave of affective focused chatbots that can benefit students’ learning process by connecting with them on a relatively more humanlike level. As part of the pilot study in the development of this chatbot, qualitative interviews and self-report data capturing student-chatbot interactions, experiences and opinions have been collected from 12 students in a Singaporean university. Thematic analysis was then employed to consolidate these findings. The results support the chatbot’s ability to display several communication immediacy techniques well, on top of responding to students at any time of the day. Having a private conversation with the chatbot also meant that the students could fully focus their attention and ask more questions to aid their learning. Improvements were suggested, in relation to the chatbot’s word detection and accuracy, accompanied by a framework to develop communication immediacy mechanics in future chatbots. Our findings support the potential of this chatbot, once modified, to be used in a similar online setting.",

The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.\nThis is a resourceful text for educators, teachers and professionals working in higher education and learning institutions. It provides training material for institutions that want to conduct faculty development programmes to prepare educators for effective coaching conversations in their universities.\nVIEW BOOK\nApplied Learning in Higher Education: Perspective, Pedagogy, and Practice\nInforming Science, 2020\nSok Mui Lim, Yong Lim Foo, Han Tong Loh, Xudong Deng\nToday, “all institutions of higher education almost everywhere in the world have been influenced by the concept of globalisation. The resulting policy changes in each nation-state have, of course, reflected the degree of the impact of globalisation on the country, hence the changes in higher education.” (Banya, 2005, p.147). This points to globalisation shaping knowledge production as well as the spread of intentional and continuous waves of innovation. The effects of globalisation on education can be seen through a) the changing paradigm from a closed system to a more open system, and b) the changing approach from a teacher-centred learning environment to that of a learner-centred environment. This changing approach culminates in the broader ideas of ‘applied learning’ through a) a productive view of learning versus the reproductive view of learning, b) constructivist versus behaviourist, c) learning facilitation versus teaching, and d) process-based assessment versus outcome-based assessment (Rudic, 2016).\nVIEW E-BOOK\nVIEW E-BOOK (FOR SIT STAFF ONLY)\nAll Publications\nShowing\n7\n-\n12\nof\n31\nresults\nThe adoption of learning analytics in blended learning environments: An exploratory study in Singapore\n14th International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge, 2024\nXiao-Feng Kenan Kok, Ching Yee Pua, Shermain Puah, Oran Zane Devilly, Peng Cheng Wang, Eric Chern-Pin Chua\nIn the aftermath of COVID-19, blended learning (BL) has emerged as the dominant mode of learning.
