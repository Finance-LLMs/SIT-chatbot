Through interdisciplinary collaboration, participants will conceptualize and develop games that foster resilience, empathy, and civic engagement. The project explores how game design can empower youth to bridge the digital divide, cultivate social cohesion, and enhance community awareness. The program concludes with a showcase at a Serious Games Festival, providing both participants and the wider community with opportunities to engage in meaningful dialogue and reflection on the societal challenges addressed in the games.",
    "Youths face challenges such as social isolation and a lack of community engagement. Traditional support methods have limitations, leading to a need for innovative approaches that empower young people. Serious games provide an interactive platform to engage youths, helping them articulate their challenges while fostering problem-solving",
    "and resilience. This research is important as it leverages the power of serious games facilitated in UDE2001 Interdisciplinary Design Innovation module to address the societal and personal challenges faced by youth. By involving them in game design, it empowers them to create solutions to the problems they face, builds confidence, and strengthens social cohesion. The outcomes of this study have the potential to influence future pedagogical approaches.",

    "Entrepreneurship, characterised by innovation in problem-solving, adaptability to change, and creativity (Heinonen, 2007), and its curriculum integration in universities have been widely reported (Hahn et al., 2017). Our research investigates whether interdisciplinary learning enhanced with an AI tool can help students cultivate entrepreneurial readiness (Schillo et al., 2016). We aim to develop a conversational AI bot to be integrated with an existing web application for collaborative learning in a university-wide interdisciplinary design innovation module. The AI bot will guide students through interdisciplinary learning and facilitate collaborative teamwork as they seek to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems, potentially informing a scalable technological entrepreneurship curriculum for the university (Munoz et al., 2011). We seek to answer these research questions and address the following themes:",
    "RQ 1a: How does participation in an interdisciplinary design innovation course, supported by a conversational AI bot and mentors from start-up businesses, influence students' entrepreneurial readiness? RQ 1b: How does participation in an interdisciplinary design innovation course, supported by a conversational AI bot and mentors from start-up businesses, influence students’ innovation abilities and collaborative skills?",

    "The collaboration seeks to empower teachers of the school to facilitate a transdisciplinary curriculum amongst lower secondary students with identified critical-design thinking as key transferable skills. Adopting SIT’s critical-design thinking for innovation framework, teachers will learn that design can be demystified with criticality in thought so that students will develop dispositions like creative confidence and critical competence. SIT researchers-instructors and teachers will jointly mentor students until the prototyping and testing phases of their projects. Overall, it is hoped that students will develop critical reflexivity as they flex their intellectual muscles to question assumptions and ideate for innovative solutions for the betterment of the community and the world.",
    "Our courage to design for good stems from a shared teaching philosophy that plays a catalytic role in our students’ work, which is to design collaboratively in transdisciplinary projects for positive social and environmental impact. All in all, we aim to build a sustainable partnership with the school teachers so that they will be able to continue to train more teachers in facilitating design innovation programmes with critical-design thinking.

    "Phase 1: This study aimed to investigate students’ learning experiences and explore the affordances of blended learning in two design innovation modules piloted in AY2021 for Year 1 undergraduates across five programmes of different clusters in SIT. As part of this research, the study involved the intentional integration of critical thinking and communicating skills, in parallel with design thinking skills that were explicit and visible to students and tutors. This endeavour aimed to fulfil SIT’s Undergraduate Programme Structure (UPS) efforts to equip students with discipline-specific knowledge, skills, abilities and key transferable skills. Thus, the research investigated the effects of using critical thinking and communicating skills as a means for deep thinking and reflection so that students could apply design thinking principles, tools and methodology to build interdisciplinary skills when fostering innovation that delivers user-centric solutions. Adopting a pragmatic approach, the mixed-methods study used surveys, online seminars/learning packages, online forum discussions and focus group discussions. Data was analysed using the Community of Inquiry framework and literature-based template coding. The research findings offered discussions on factors influencing student learning and enhancing student learning outcomes, and student application of transferable critical design thinking skills in interdisciplinary work. Finally, as the research is contextualized in a blended learning environment, the study also offered reflections and proposed recommendations for an enhanced instructional model of blended learning environment that can be adopted.",

As part of this research, the study will involve the intentional integration of critical thinking and futures thinking skills in parallel with design thinking skills, such they are explicit and visible to students and instructors. It will investigate the effects of using critical, design and futures thinking skills as a means for higher-order thinking and deep reflection so that students can ultimately apply humanity-centred principles and approaches, tools and methodology to build interdisciplinary skills when fostering innovation for real-world problems. Recommendations will be made at the end of the study for adjustments to the module design and delivery.",

    "The study aimed to examine the transfer of critical thinking skills in students’ written and oral communication in the assessments of the Critical Thinking and Communicating (CTC) modules, contextualised in discipline-specific content, within five four SIT participating pilot programmes. These programmes were Robotics, Digital Communication and Integrated Media, Physiotherapy, Pharmaceutical Engineering and Speech and Language Therapy. Specifically, the study documented the similarities and differences in the design and delivery, based on the specific writing and speaking needs of the students in each of the programmes. It also detailed the way in which these different needs are integrated into the module to facilitate students’ understanding and application of critical thinking skills in their discipline-specific reading, writing and speaking activities in class as evidenced in their graded assignments. Additionally, it documented tutors’ and students’ critical reflection on how learning outcomes can be enhanced such that the successes and areas for improvement for all five modules are elucidated. The findings were used to make recommendations for adjustments to be implemented in the module design, assessment and delivery of the CTC module in the five four pilot programmes as well as in future programmes to be rolled out with the harmonization of all SIT undergraduate programmes.",

    "The longitudinal study explored the affordances of blended learning and investigated students’ learning experiences in a critical thinking and writing course for a large cohort of engineering students. It also investigated the effects of using critical thinking and writing skills, which consequently leads students to internalize engineering leadership (one of the topics in the blended learning (BL) module). Adopting a pragmatic approach, the mixed-methods study used surveys, online forums, classroom observations and scenario-based reflections. Data gathered were analysed using the Community of Inquiry (COI) framework and literature-based template coding. The research concludes with discussions on key factors in influencing student learning, immediately after the course, and student internalisation of engineering leadership, beyond the course. In future, with further analysis of the data, it aims to propose an enhanced instructional model of blended learning environment and strategies for curriculum redesign that can be adopted for any BL course.",

    "In the wake of the pandemic, the urgent need for higher education (HE) institutions to adapt and innovate has become increasingly apparent, particularly in light of accelerated digital transformation. This chapter addresses the critical challenge facing universities: reconciling the paradox of technology in HE to ensure it acts as a catalyst rather than as a barrier to inclusive and applied learning. As the global landscape becomes more complex and interconnected, graduates must be prepared to engage with multiple fields and perspectives and collaborate with professionals from diverse backgrounds. This necessitates a shift from traditional discipline-focused curricula towards transdisciplinary learning, which fosters critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and human skills valued in the workforce. Additionally, this approach encourages creativity and innovation by allowing students to explore diverse ideas and methodologies that may not emerge within the confines of a single discipline. By embracing this shift, HE institutions can better equip graduates with the skills needed to navigate the complex challenges of the 21st century and remain adaptable in an evolving world. (Sin & Reid, 2005).",
    "This chapter begins by exploring how institutes of higher learning (IHLs) can evolve into institutes of continual learning (ICLs) to ensure graduates are future-ready and capable of creating value in a rapidly changing world. It discusses the strategic opportunities and change drivers impacting the future of higher education, emphasising the need for a business transformation towards transdisciplinary learning and Education 4.0. To align educational strategies with real-world applications effectively, it is crucial to understand how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming various industries and what HE can learn from these changes. Thus, the next section offers a comparative discussion on the adoption and impact of AI across multiple industries. Distilling insights from earlier chapters in the book, this section highlights how AI transforms industries such as advertising, creative, healthcare, legal, leadership, customer experience, lifestyle, and disciplines such as interdisciplinary workplace, student development, and career coaching. Understanding these industry leaders’ perspectives is crucial for IHLs to align their programmes with the evolving demands of the workforce. By examining the opportunities and ethical considerations in AI adoption, the discussion sets the stage for how these insights can inform and enhance HE curricula.",
    "The chapter then delves into the importance of balancing innovation with ethical responsibility, proposing how HE can bridge the gap with industry through design, strategy, and innovation programmes, leveraging critical design futures (CDF) thinking and generative AI. It advocates for a Freirean approach to consider ethical, social, and privacy issues, ensuring that adopting AI and new technologies in HE is inclusive and beneficial for all stakeholders. Finally, the chapter's concluding sections offer insights into emerging technologies in HE, the role of pedagogical intelligent agents, and how these insights inform the need to redesign HE curricula and programmes. This chapter emphasises the significance of bridging the industry-HE gap to prepare students for the future of work, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to navigate and lead in a rapidly changing world.",

    "A fascinating shift marks the journey of technological evolution. Historically, humans were trained to build and operate machines. This education emphasised mechanical skills, logical thinking, and problem-solving abilities, laying the groundwork for the following industrial revolutions. Early machines, from the steam engine to the assembly line, were designed and maintained by skilled human workers, reflecting a one-way relationship where humans were the creators and controllers of machines.",
    "Today, we stand on the brink of a new paradigm. Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems and generative AI tools are not just aiding human tasks but are also capable of educating and guiding humans. These intelligent machines can analyse vast amounts of data, provide personalised learning experiences, and generate creative content. The transformation from humans building machines to machines educating humans signifies a profound shift in our technological landscape, impacting industries.",
    "As editors, we are united by a profound conviction that bridging the gap between industry and higher education is imperative in the face of rapid advancements in generative AI and innovations across various industries. This connection is crucial to equipping graduates and young professionals with the skills to innovate and excel in the future workforce. Through this multidisciplinary exploration,",

    "The Play it Forward project aims to equip youth as co-creators of serious games to address societal and personal challenges. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, participants will conceptualize and develop games that foster resilience, empathy, and civic engagement. The project explores how game design can empower youth to bridge the digital divide, cultivate social cohesion, and enhance community awareness. The program concludes with a showcase at a Serious Games Festival, providing both participants and the wider community with opportunities to engage in meaningful dialogue and reflection on the societal challenges addressed in the games.\nYouths face challenges such as social isolation and a lack of community engagement. Traditional support methods have limitations, leading to a need for innovative approaches that empower young people. Serious games provide an interactive platform to engage youths, helping them articulate their challenges while fostering problem-solving\nand resilience. This research is important as it leverages the power of serious games facilitated in UDE2001 Interdisciplinary Design Innovation module to address the societal and personal challenges faced by youth. By involving them in game design, it empowers them to create solutions to the problems they face, builds confidence, and strengthens social cohesion. The outcomes of this study have the potential to influence future pedagogical approaches.\nNational Youth Council (NYF)\nPrincipal Investigator\n$50,000",
    "Entrepreneurship, characterised by innovation in problem-solving, adaptability to change, and creativity (Heinonen, 2007), and its curriculum integration in universities have been widely reported (Hahn et al., 2017). Our research investigates whether interdisciplinary learning enhanced with an AI tool can help students cultivate entrepreneurial readiness (Schillo et al., 2016). We aim to develop a conversational AI bot to be integrated with an existing web application for collaborative learning in a university-wide interdisciplinary design innovation module. The AI bot will guide students through interdisciplinary learning and facilitate collaborative teamwork as they seek to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems, potentially informing a scalable technological entrepreneurship curriculum for the university (Munoz et al., 2011). We seek to answer these research questions and address the following themes:\nRQ 1a: How does participation in an interdisciplinary design innovation course, supported by a conversational AI bot and mentors from start-up businesses, influence students' entrepreneurial readiness? RQ 1b: How does participation in an interdisciplinary design innovation course, supported by a conversational AI bot and mentors from start-up businesses, influence students’ innovation abilities and collaborative skills?\nMOE Tertiary Education Research Fund\nPrincipal Investigator\n$194,428.60",

Our project will leverage on the expertise of Art, Language, Social Studies (Applied Learning Programme) secondary school teachers to inspire students to imagine a future of sustainable practices.\nThe collaboration seeks to empower teachers of the school to facilitate a transdisciplinary curriculum amongst lower secondary students with identified critical-design thinking as key transferable skills. Adopting SIT’s critical-design thinking for innovation framework, teachers will learn that design can be demystified with criticality in thought so that students will develop dispositions like creative confidence and critical competence. SIT researchers-instructors and teachers will jointly mentor students until the prototyping and testing phases of their projects. Overall, it is hoped that students will develop critical reflexivity as they flex their intellectual muscles to question assumptions and ideate for innovative solutions for the betterment of the community and the world.\nOur courage to design for good stems from a shared teaching philosophy that plays a catalytic role in our students’ work, which is to design collaboratively in transdisciplinary projects for positive social and environmental impact. All in all, we aim to build a sustainable partnership with the school teachers so that they will be able to continue to train more teachers in facilitating design innovation programmes with critical-design thinking.

    "ALIGN (SIT), $14k\nPrincipal Investigator\nPhase 1: This study aimed to investigate students’ learning experiences and explore the affordances of blended learning in two design innovation modules piloted in AY2021 for Year 1 undergraduates across five programmes of different clusters in SIT. As part of this research, the study involved the intentional integration of critical thinking and communicating skills, in parallel with design thinking skills that were explicit and visible to students and tutors. This endeavour aimed to fulfil SIT’s Undergraduate Programme Structure (UPS) efforts to equip students with discipline-specific knowledge, skills, abilities and key transferable skills. Thus, the research investigated the effects of using critical thinking and communicating skills as a means for deep thinking and reflection so that students could apply design thinking principles, tools and methodology to build interdisciplinary skills when fostering innovation that delivers user-centric solutions. Adopting a pragmatic approach, the mixed-methods study used surveys, online seminars/learning packages, online forum discussions and focus group discussions. Data was analysed using the Community of Inquiry framework and literature-based template coding. The research findings offered discussions on factors influencing student learning and enhancing student learning outcomes, and student application of transferable critical design thinking skills in interdisciplinary work. Finally, as the research is contextualized in a blended learning environment, the study also offered reflections and proposed recommendations for an enhanced instructional model of blended learning environment that can be adopted.\nExtended Phase 2: This study aims to investigate students’ learning experiences and explore the affordances of blended learning in two design innovation modules. As part of this research, the study will involve the intentional integration of critical thinking and futures thinking skills in parallel with design thinking skills, such they are explicit and visible to students and instructors. It will investigate the effects of using critical, design and futures thinking skills as a means for higher-order thinking and deep reflection so that students can ultimately apply humanity-centred principles and approaches, tools and methodology to build interdisciplinary skills when fostering innovation for real-world problems. Recommendations will be made at the end of the study for adjustments to the module design and delivery.",
    "Co-principal Investigator\nThe study aimed to examine the transfer of critical thinking skills in students’ written and oral communication in the assessments of the Critical Thinking and Communicating (CTC) modules, contextualised in discipline-specific content, within five four SIT participating pilot programmes. These programmes were Robotics, Digital Communication and Integrated Media, Physiotherapy, Pharmaceutical Engineering and Speech and Language Therapy. Specifically, the study documented the similarities and differences in the design and delivery, based on the specific writing and speaking needs of the students in each of the programmes. It also detailed the way in which these different needs are integrated into the module to facilitate students’ understanding and application of critical thinking skills in their discipline-specific reading, writing and speaking activities in class as evidenced in their graded assignments. Additionally, it documented tutors’ and students’ critical reflection on how learning outcomes can be enhanced such that the successes and areas for improvement for all five modules are elucidated. The findings were used to make recommendations for adjustments to be implemented in the module design, assessment and delivery of the CTC module in the five four pilot programmes as well as in future programmes to be rolled out with the harmonization of all SIT undergraduate programmes.",

In this introduction to the issue, we explain how CTC is a response to emerging challenges in Higher Education (HE) and suggest that it is an area that holds potential for further innovations in pedagogical research and instructional design.",
    "Principal Investigator: Nadya Shaznay Patel\nThe longitudinal study explored the affordances of blended learning and investigated students’ learning experiences in a critical thinking and writing course for a large cohort of engineering students. It also investigated the effects of using critical thinking and writing skills, which consequently leads students to internalize engineering leadership (one of the topics in the blended learning (BL) module). Adopting a pragmatic approach, the mixed-methods study used surveys, online forums, classroom observations and scenario-based reflections. Data gathered were analysed using the Community of Inquiry (COI) framework and literature-based template coding. The research concludes with discussions on key factors in influencing student learning, immediately after the course, and student internalisation of engineering leadership, beyond the course. In future, with further analysis of the data, it aims to propose an enhanced instructional model of blended learning environment and strategies for curriculum redesign that can be adopted for any BL course.\n(NUS Teaching Enhancement Grant.

    "Patel, N. S. (2025). Bridging the Industry-Higher Education Gap with Critical Design Futures Thinking and GenAI for Innovation. In N. S. Patel & N. Indurkhya (Eds.),  The Rise of Intelligent Machines A Multi-disciplinary Perspective from Industry and Impact on Higher Education (pp. 268-288). USA: CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group.\nIn the wake of the pandemic, the urgent need for higher education (HE) institutions to adapt and innovate has become increasingly apparent, particularly in light of accelerated digital transformation. This chapter addresses the critical challenge facing universities: reconciling the paradox of technology in HE to ensure it acts as a catalyst rather than as a barrier to inclusive and applied learning. As the global landscape becomes more complex and interconnected, graduates must be prepared to engage with multiple fields and perspectives and collaborate with professionals from diverse backgrounds. This necessitates a shift from traditional discipline-focused curricula towards transdisciplinary learning, which fosters critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and human skills valued in the workforce. Additionally, this approach encourages creativity and innovation by allowing students to explore diverse ideas and methodologies that may not emerge within the confines of a single discipline. By embracing this shift, HE institutions can better equip graduates with the skills needed to navigate the complex challenges of the 21st century and remain adaptable in an evolving world. (Sin & Reid, 2005).\nThis chapter begins by exploring how institutes of higher learning (IHLs) can evolve into institutes of continual learning (ICLs) to ensure graduates are future-ready and capable of creating value in a rapidly changing world. It discusses the strategic opportunities and change drivers impacting the future of higher education, emphasising the need for a business transformation towards transdisciplinary learning and Education 4.0. To align educational strategies with real-world applications effectively, it is crucial to understand how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming various industries and what HE can learn from these changes. Thus, the next section offers a comparative discussion on the adoption and impact of AI across multiple industries. Distilling insights from earlier chapters in the book, this section highlights how AI transforms industries such as advertising, creative, healthcare, legal, leadership, customer experience, lifestyle, and disciplines such as interdisciplinary workplace, student development, and career coaching. Understanding these industry leaders’ perspectives is crucial for IHLs to align their programmes with the evolving demands of the workforce. By examining the opportunities and ethical considerations in AI adoption, the discussion sets the stage for how these insights can inform and enhance HE curricula.\nThe chapter then delves into the importance of balancing innovation with ethical responsibility, proposing how HE can bridge the gap with industry through design, strategy, and innovation programmes, leveraging critical design futures (CDF) thinking and generative AI. It advocates for a Freirean approach to consider ethical, social, and privacy issues, ensuring that adopting AI and new technologies in HE is inclusive and beneficial for all stakeholders. Finally, the chapter's concluding sections offer insights into emerging technologies in HE, the role of pedagogical intelligent agents, and how these insights inform the need to redesign HE curricula and programmes. This chapter emphasises the significance of bridging the industry-HE gap to prepare students for the future of work, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to navigate and lead in a rapidly changing world.",

United CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group. https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003469551\nA fascinating shift marks the journey of technological evolution. Historically, humans were trained to build and operate machines. This education emphasised mechanical skills, logical thinking, and problem-solving abilities, laying the groundwork for the following industrial revolutions. Early machines, from the steam engine to the assembly line, were designed and maintained by skilled human workers, reflecting a one-way relationship where humans were the creators and controllers of machines.\nToday, we stand on the brink of a new paradigm. Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems and generative AI tools are not just aiding human tasks but are also capable of educating and guiding humans. These intelligent machines can analyse vast amounts of data, provide personalised learning experiences, and generate creative content. The transformation from humans building machines to machines educating humans signifies a profound shift in our technological landscape, impacting industries.\nAs editors, we are united by a profound conviction that bridging the gap between industry and higher education is imperative in the face of rapid advancements in generative AI and innovations across various industries. This connection is crucial to equipping graduates and young professionals with the skills to innovate and excel in the future workforce. Through this multidisciplinary exploration,\nThe Rise of Intelligent Machines\naims to provide readers with an understanding of AI's transformative potential and the strategies needed to harness its benefits for industry and education.\nEvery chapter reflects our shared passion for AI’s potential and close industry-higher education collaboration, and we hope that our work inspires you to embrace the opportunities and challenges of the future with curiosity and confidence.",

Singapore Institute of Technology. Book. https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003332176\nThis practical guide for educators in higher education encourages readers to ask effective coaching questions and apply relevant coaching techniques to empower and engage students to grow and perform at their best.\nFilled with authentic examples and handy tips, the book takes readers from the ‘how to’ of coaching, through the practicalities, challenges and honing of existing skills and new capabilities. The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.\nThis is a resourceful text for educators, teachers and professionals working in higher education and learning institutions. It provides training material for institutions that want to conduct faculty development programmes to prepare educators for effective coaching conversations in their universities.",
