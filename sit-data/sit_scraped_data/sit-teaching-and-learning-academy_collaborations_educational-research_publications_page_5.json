    "This practical guide for educators in higher education encourages readers to ask effective coaching questions and apply relevant coaching techniques to empower and engage students to grow and perform at their best.",
    "Filled with authentic examples and handy tips, the book takes readers from the ‘how to’ of coaching, through the practicalities, challenges and honing of existing skills and new capabilities. The authors recognise that in educators’ daily encounters and interactions with students, there are many timely coachable moments for authentic learning. These opportunities can enable students to learn beyond what is squarely in their curriculum and develop their own pathways to become work-ready graduates. Through coaching, educators help students discover more about themselves while guiding them to innovate and generate solutions to perceived and real-world problems. This guide offers in depth discussions along with tools and tips to provide invaluable guidance for educators to get acquainted with the key skills needed to coach students for success in various academic and professional contexts. The content covers multiple varied scenarios, from classrooms and assignments, to internships and group work, and highlights various coaching opportunities with practical strategies.",

    "Today, “all institutions of higher education almost everywhere in the world have been influenced by the concept of globalisation. The resulting policy changes in each nation-state have, of course, reflected the degree of the impact of globalisation on the country, hence the changes in higher education.” (Banya, 2005, p.147). This points to globalisation shaping knowledge production as well as the spread of intentional and continuous waves of innovation. The effects of globalisation on education can be seen through a) the changing paradigm from a closed system to a more open system, and b) the changing approach from a teacher-centred learning environment to that of a learner-centred environment. This changing approach culminates in the broader ideas of ‘applied learning’ through a) a productive view of learning versus the reproductive view of learning, b) constructivist versus behaviourist, c) learning facilitation versus teaching, and d) process-based assessment versus outcome-based assessment (Rudic, 2016).",
