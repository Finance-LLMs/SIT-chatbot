What does it take to nurture the next generation of occupational therapists?

Meet Professor Tan Bhing Leet, SIT’s Cluster Director for Health and Social Sciences, and an occupational therapist whose passion for people goes beyond the classroom.

Her journey as an OT has been shaped by a dedicated commitment to supporting individuals with complex mental health needs — from pursuing a Master’s in Mental Health to building up applied research in cognitive rehabilitation.

A firm believer in walking the talk, Prof Bhing Leet stays grounded in the community through her engagements with Allkin Singapore and AWWA, ensuring SIT remains connected to the communities we serve.

This belief in real-world relevance also shapes her teaching. To her, learning doesn’t end with having the right answer but how her students think, reason, and connect with their patients.

Stay tuned as we share more inspiring journeys from the SIT community.

Darren didn’t just study food technology – he lived it. At SIT, he transformed a sustainability challenge into a real-world innovation, turning inedible kale stalks into a nutritious snack called Snackikale.

His journey began with a passion for science, strengthened by SIT’s applied learning, industry collaboration, and guidance from dedicated professors.

From paramedic to nursing student, Sunnie’s journey is a testament to how growth begins with the courage to evolve.

After years serving on the frontlines of emergency care, she felt a deeper calling – to walk alongside patients not just in moments of crisis, but throughout their entire healing process. That conviction brought her to SIT, where she’s now expanding her impact and redefining her role in healthcare with purpose and heart.

At SIT, Sunnie isn’t just learning – she’s becoming. She’s shaping herself into a future-ready nurse: one who leads with empathy, advocates with confidence, and brings meaningful care to every patient’s journey.

From the high-stakes urgency of emergency response to the holistic care of nursing – Sunnie’s journey is a powerful reminder that it’s never too late to rewrite your story. Inspired to take your next step? Learn more at the link in bio.

For Jarrod, SIT wasn’t just about earning a degree, it was where he found the confidence to turn ideas into reality. Now the founder of Spaceytales, a creative edtech company, Jarrod credits SIT’s hands-on, applied learning approach for shaping his entrepreneurial journey.

“SIT felt different. Other universities focused a lot on theory-first learning, but I liked that SIT takes an applied, hands-on approach. I wanted to try things, break things, and learn by actually doing.”

It wasn’t just about academic studies – it was about hands-on experimentation, learning through failure, and problem-solving in real time. One of his most unforgettable moments? Seizing the opportunity to pitch a children’s book series idea to an astronaut on the spot – and receiving a resounding yes.

He values how both requires adaptability, practical problem solving skills, and comfort navigating the unpredictable, non-linear path to success.

Move over, croissants — cabbage is having its moment.⁣

⁣

Say bonjour to Bernadette Rozario, CIA Singapore alumna and sous-chef at [@claudinerestaurant](https://www.instagram.com/claudinerestaurant/), who wowed judges in France to be crowned the first-ever Stuffed Cabbage World Champion – beating out 110 chefs from around the world (including one from Élysée Palace 👀).⁣

⁣

Her winning take on the classic Chou Farci or Stuffed Cabbage is a delicious blend of tradition, innovation, and fond childhood memories. Also, there was foie gras \*chef’s kiss\*⁣

⁣

From CIA Singapore and SIT to the world stage, Bernadette’s journey is stuffed with passion, precision, and a powerful message: talent in the kitchen knows no gender — just grit. ⁣

⁣

Who knew cabbage could look this good? Savour Bernadette's full story at the link in bio.

Jedi wisdom… or student life in disguise? 👀

“You must unlearn what you have learned,” Yoda says. At SIT, we call it the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn – part of our SITizen-DNA. Switching gears, picking up new skills, shifting perspectives… trust the process, you will.

May the 4th be with you.

That’s a wrap! 🚀

We had an incredible time at the SIT x NVIDIA AI Centre (SNAIC) Half-Day Showcase! From Large Language Models to Multimodal and Generative AI, we explored how innovative tech is solving real-world challenges and creating new opportunities. 💡✨

From an AI Debater app that leverages LLMs and speech technologies to simulate live debates, to GENESIS, a project employing graph-based retrieval-augmented generation and a domain-specific chatbot to streamline safety investigations across sectors—these are just a few of the innovative projects showcased at the event.

Big thanks to everyone who joined us — let’s keep pushing the boundaries in AI together! 💬🤖
