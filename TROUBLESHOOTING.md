# Quick Fix Summary for STT 500 Error

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Environment Variables
**Problem**: Extra spaces and quotes in `.env` file
**Fixed**: Cleaned up the `.env` file format:
```
XI_API_KEY=sk_947d7c6316e1efef0b5edd9a107473c7743fbd5d75129890
AGENT_ID=agent_01jwrvx2g5fsatnz7g9hmy35pf
PORT=3000
```

### 2. Audio Validation
**Problem**: Empty or very small audio files being sent to STT API
**Fixed**: Added validation in backend:
- Check for minimum file size (1KB)
- Validate file exists and has content
- Better error messages

### 3. Better Error Handling
**Added**:
- More detailed logging in backend
- Better error messages in frontend
- Audio format detection and fallbacks
- Recording status indicators

## How to Test:

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open the application**: `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Test recording**:
   - Click "Start Recording" 
   - Speak clearly for at least 2-3 seconds
   - Click "Stop Recording"
   - Check browser console for detailed logs

## Troubleshooting:

If you still get 500 errors, check:

1. **Browser Console**: Look for detailed error messages
2. **Server Console**: Check what the backend is logging
3. **Audio Recording**: Ensure you're speaking loud enough and long enough
4. **Microphone**: Make sure browser has microphone permission

## Common Issues:

- **Empty audio**: Record for longer (at least 2-3 seconds)
- **No microphone permission**: Browser will ask for permission
- **Wrong audio format**: Code now auto-detects supported formats
- **API key issues**: Check .env file has no extra spaces/quotes

The application should now provide much better error messages to help identify exactly what's going wrong.
